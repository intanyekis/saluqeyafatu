Combate America's 2019 PPV event with former <strong><a href=#>UFC</a></strong> light heavyweight champion Tito Ortiz taking on former WWE champion Alberto Del Rio is near the top of the billing when discussing this topic. However, Combate America is not alone in making weird fights.</p><h2 id=charles-bennett-vs-minoru-kimura><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Charles Bennett vs. Minoru Kimura</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Charles-Bennett-1.jpg><p>When RIZIN signed one of the top kickboxers on the planet in Minoru Kimura, they likely had the expectation of making him one of the top stars of their company. Matchmaking is hard for a man making his MMA debut, but they decided to go with a fan favorite in Charles "Krazy Horse" Bennett.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's a bit of a strange fight considering Kimura was a hyped prospect, and Bennett was a veteran of over 60 fights but hadn't been relevant in over a decade. Against all odds, Bennett somehow won the bout via a seven-second knockout.</p><h2 id=jorge-masvidal-vs-raphael-assuncao><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Jorge Masvidal vs. Raphael Assuncao</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/jorge-masvidal-nate-diaz-ufc-bmfjpg.jpg><p>Jorge Masvidal is one of the most well-known fighters on the planet, while Raphael Assuncao is considered one of the best bantamweights on the planet. Despite these men spending the majority of their careers 35 pounds apart, they actually fought under the Full Throttle promotion in Georgia in 2005.</p><p>The two men met in the middle at 155lbs, and Masvidal naturally looked much bigger than Assuncao. Wildly, Assuncao dominated the bout and won via a wide unanimous decision.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jose-canseco-vs-hong-man-choi><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Jose Canseco vs. Hong-Man Choi</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Jose-Canseco.jpg><p>It's borderline insane that this fight was even sanctioned. Canseco has said that he's a black belt in Karate, but there's very little proof that this is actually the case. That's a fair thing to question considering that when Canseco actually fought he looked like he had zero qualifications.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 UFC Fighters Who Were WAY Too Big For Their Weight Class</a></span></p><p>In all fairness to Canseco, he didn't have an easy opponent. His debut was against 7'2' kickboxer Hong-Man Choi in the <a href=#>Japan-based Dream promotion</a>. Canseco lost the matchup via TKO in a bit over a minute.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=james-toney-vs-randy-couture><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>James Toney vs. Randy Couture</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/James-Toney-Cropped.jpg><p>It's not that weird nowadays, but it was insane back in 2010 when <a href=#>former boxing champion James Toney</a> decided that he wanted to step in the Octagon. It's incredibly rare to see boxers step into the cage, and it's even rarer that they fight one of the best fighters on the planet in their first bout.</p><p>But that's exactly what happened at UFC 118, as the two Hall of Famers from different sports squared off. Randy Couture dominated the freak show fight and won in the first round via submission.</p><h2 id=royce-gracie-vs-matt-hughes><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Royce Gracie vs. Matt Hughes</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Matt-Hughes-vs-Royce-Gracie.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's still strange that these two squared off. Two icons from two different eras, Royce Gracie squared off with Matt Hughes in a catchweight bout at UFC 60. The bout was promoted as the first real superfight in UFC history, and the two men had to meet at 175lbs because they were in two different weight classes.</p><p>Unfortunately for Gracie, he came out on the wrong end of the first superfight. He got dominated and shown the game had passed him by, as Hughes won via first-round TKO.</p><h2 id=gabi-garcia-vs-yumiko-hotta><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Gabi Garcia vs. Yumiko Hotta</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Gabi-Garcia-in-training.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Okay, Japan has always been the wild west for MMA. However, this one seems wild even for them. Gabi Garcia is well-known as arguably the only heavyweight in women's MMA, as she routinely weighs in at over 215lbs for her bouts. She's had issues finding opponents as a result, but for some reason, <a href=#>a 50-year-old Yumiko Hotta stepped up for RIZIN</a> in 2016.</p><p>Watching the size difference and skill difference between the two felt criminal. Garcia predictably won via first-round slaughter.</p><h2 id=cm-punk-vs-mike-jackson><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>CM Punk vs. Mike Jackson</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/USATSI_10884194.jpg><p>Both of <a href=#>CM Punk's bouts could be considered bizarre</a>, but his first against Mickey Gall wasn't that strange. Gall was a hot prospect at the time, and the UFC has taken gambles on stars such as Punk before. What's strange is that they asked him back after he lost.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even weirder, they matched him up with a fellow 0-1 fighter on a UFC PPV. Punk lost to Mike Jackson, but the fun carried into the post-fight, as Jackson tested positive for marijuana and the bout was turned into a no-contest.</p><h2 id=brock-lesnar-vs-randy-couture><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Brock Lesnar vs. Randy Couture</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Brock-Lensar-UFC-226-Cropped.jpg><p>Man, Randy Couture has some weird names on his resume. When Couture was during his final title reign, there weren't many title challengers left around for 'The Natural', and so the UFC decided to throw a 2-1 wrestler-turned football player-turned MMA fighter Brock Lesnar at him.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 UFC Fighters MMA Fans Were Happy To See Lose</a></span></p><p>Despite the insane amount of experience, Lesnar was able to pull off the win by knocking out Couture in the second round to become UFC champion in his fourth bout.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=muhammad-ali-vs-antonio-inoki><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Muhammad Ali vs. Antonio Inoki</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Muhammad-Ali-Vs-Antonio-Inoki-Cropped.jpg><p>Widely considered to be the first-ever MMA fight, then WBC heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali faced off against pro-wrestler Antonio Inoki in 1976. The rules for the bout were seemingly anything goes, but over the years this has been questioned. Regardless, it was a match between a current boxing champion and a wrestler that birthed MMA.</p><p>Sadly, the fight was terrible. Inoki was seemingly terrified of staying on the feet for long, so Ali didn't have many chances to do much. Ali only landed six punches the entire fight, while Inoki landed 106 kicks from his back and scored one takedown. Inoki was deducted a few points, and the terrible fight was ruled a draw.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tito-ortiz-vs-alberto-del-rio><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Tito Ortiz vs. Alberto Del Rio</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Alberto-Del-Rio-MMA-Cropped.jpg><p>It's forgotten that Alberto Del Rio previously had an MMA career before getting into pro wrestling. Del Rio was previously an amateur wrestler who moved into MMA and had a record of 9-5 with his most notable moment being knocked out by Mirko Cro Cop in 2003. Despite Del Rio not having fought in nine years, he decided to fight for Combate Americas.</p><p>The promotion decided to match him up with former UFC champion Tito Ortiz. Both men carried around their former titles for the promotion, as it was billed as "UFC vs. WWE". Predictably Ortiz won via first-round submission.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmeknsGwec6rq6KyXZa5o7HRraZmnJWherO1zmakqKukYq%2BqxsCrqZ5llp60qcDSZqSmmV2dtrTAzquwZq2WmHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
