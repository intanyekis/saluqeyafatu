Rock also looked casual in a <a href=#>New York Knicks</a> jacket, which he paired with a black baseball cap.</p><p class=p1>Diplo further explained in his Instagram caption that he “legit walked the side of the road for hours” and even <a href=#>hitchhiked with his “thumb out.”</a> Diplo added that he needed to leave the festival to<a href=#> make it to his concert in Washington D.C.</a> later that evening. “I have a show in D.C. tonight and didn’t want to let y’all down,” he added. “Also shoutout to this guy for making the smart purchase of a truck not knowing it was for this exact moment&nbsp;<span class=s1>❤️</span>.”</p><p class=p1>Rock also documented the pair’s ordeal, showing footage of the thick mud on his own Instagram Story on Saturday.</p><p class=p1>Diplo proclaimed via his Instagram Stories that they eventually “made it out” of Burning Man — and in time for his concert. “No one was making it out of Burning Man, they didn’t believe we would walk 6 miles in the mud,” he captioned a second post while sitting on a private plane. “No one believed we would get to DC for the show tonight. But, God did.”</p><p class=p1>The desert, which is the home of Burning Man, received up to 0.8 inches of rainfall on Friday, September 1, and Saturday, September 2. Due to the intense amount of rain, the dirt on the ground turned into a thick, clay-like mud that was difficult to maneuver through on foot or by car.</p><p class=p1>Local officials urged<a href=#> attendees of the weeklong festival</a> to “shelter in place” and conserve their food and water. Organizers also requested anyone traveling to Burning Man on Saturday should avoid making the trek.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/What-s-Happening-at-Burning-Man-Chris-Rock-and-Diplo-Escape-and-More1.png><p class=p1>“Participants inbound for the event should turn around and head home,” the Bureau of Land Management told <a href=#>NBC News</a> in a Saturday statement.</p><p class=p1>According to X (formerly Twitter) posts on <a href=#>the festival’s Traffic page</a>, organizers shut down the Black Rock City gates and no cars were permitted on the grounds except for emergency vehicles.</p><p class=p1>“The gate and airport in and out of Black Rock City remain closed.
