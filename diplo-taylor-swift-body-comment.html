According to Diplo, his tweet about Swift's butt wasn't supposed to be taken seriously. In fact, he wasn't taking Twitter seriously at all at the time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He revealed, "I don't take it that seriously. When I first started using social media, it was a big joke for me. On Twitter, I was an unabashedly crazy person. And I didn't realize that there was power in those words. I would make fun of other artists, and that really came back to hurt me in the end."</p><p>So what exactly did Diplo tweet about?</p><p>"Someone should make a kickstarter to get Taylor Swift a booty."</p><p>Diplo received instant backlash for his comments, and that would also include Lorde stepping in and making a tweet of her own.</p><p>"@Diplo," she replied, "should we do something about your tiny pe*** while we're at it hm."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/taylor-swift-4.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:09</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ttweb_the-truth-about-morgan-wallen-s-tour-earnings-and-why-he-joked-about-being-as-popular-as-taylor-swiftthe-truth-about-morgan-wallen-s-tour-earnings-and-why-he-joked-about-being-as-popular-as-taylor-swift_bk_a1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>The Truth About Morgan Wallen’s Tour Earnings And Why He Joked About Being As Popular As Taylor Swift</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Does Morgan Wallen make as much money from touring as Taylor Swift, and is that why he joked about the beloved pop singer?</span><p>As expected, Diplo had regrets about the tweet, calling it "the worst decision of my career."</p><h2 id=diplo-admitted-the-tweet-was-a-big-mistake>Diplo Admitted The Tweet Was A Big Mistake</h2><p>Diplo certainly regretted his decision and admitted he wasn't prepared for such a reaction from the Swifties, coming to Taylor's defense.</p><p>Diplo revealed, "All I know is, don't ever get into a feud with Taylor Swift," he said at the time. "She has like fifty million people that will die for her. It's like an army that's worse than North Korea. You can't step into that arena. That was something I was never prepared for."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/instar53424463.jpg> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/taylor-swift-performs-during-the-reputation-tour-at-hard-rock-stadium.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Travis Kelce Seems To Respond To Taylor Swift Pregnancy Rumors By Emphasizing She’s Too Career-Driven</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Travis Kelce responds to the incessant rumors that he and Taylor Swift will settle down soon saying their careers are the priority.</span><p>Diplo went on to add that he was actually friends with Lorde at the time, and the media really was overblowing what had taken place.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"And it's funny, because me and Lorde, we're actually friends, and it was a funny, in-jest conversation," he later added. "So many tabloids used it to make it story, when it was not. Literally, it was such a tongue-in-cheek joke on both sides. I think Taylor Swift is such an impactful character, that it was because she was involved that it became really big."</p><p>He continues, "I thought it was so funny, but you know, people hold you accountable for your Twitter in such a strange way. It's not real life. Sarcasm doesn't come through on social media."</p><p>Without a doubt, it was a tough moment for Diplo who felt the wrath of Swift's fanbase. In truth, it wasn't the only time an artist was bashed for going after Taylor Swift.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=diplo-was-far-from-the-only-artist-to-face-the-consequences-of-going-after-taylor-swift>Diplo Was Far From The Only Artist To Face The Consequences Of Going After Taylor Swift</h2><p>We've seen this at various points. If fans have a feeling that Swift is getting bashed by another artist, they immediately come to her defense. Back in 2015, it seemed like Nicki Minaj was another artist taking a shot at Taylor Swift. Once again, Minaj took to Twitter, discussing her frustrations with the VMAs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/taylor-swift-1.jpg><p>"If your video celebrates women with very slim bodies, you will be nominated for vid of the year," she wrote.</p><p>Swift and her fans were immediately upset, thinking that was a shot at the artist.</p><p>Swift replied, "I've done nothing but love & support you. It's unlike you to pit women against each other. Maybe one of the men took your slot."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Turns out that the entire situation was a misunderstanding, and Minaj claims that the media twisted her words. Or, Minaj might've wanted to drop it given the backlash that came with it. Nonetheless, Taylor did her best to end the drama.</p><p>Swift tweeted, "I thought I was being called out. I missed the point, I misunderstood, then misspoke. I'm sorry, Nicki."</p><p>At the very least, things were settled before they were able to get any worse.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiboqicpHq1rdilpqtlo6y2p8CMm6adsV2YvK65xKeraA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
