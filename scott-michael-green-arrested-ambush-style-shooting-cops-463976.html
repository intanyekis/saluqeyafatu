There’s definitely danger out there right now. We’re very well aware of the society that we’re living in right now and the time and that there are some not-so-positive views of law enforcement that a segment of our population holds.”</p><p>While no motive has been determined, two unearthed videos from Oct. 14 have made their rounds.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p>In the video posted by <a href=# rel=nofollow>BuzzFeed News</a>, Greene is arguing with police officers after he was removed from a high school athletic event at&nbsp;Urbandale High School. Greene posted two videos to his YouTube account, one with a still photo of himself holding a Confederate flag next to a group of African-Americans and the other, his exchange with the Uniondale police officers titled, “Police Abuse, Civil Rights Violation at Urbandale High School.”</p><p>In the comments section, Greene refers to the group as “the blacks” and says in the second clip he was protesting his right to free speech. He also claims he was assaulted by a police officer and someone in the crowd, but failed to give an accurate description.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/sub-buzz-11656-1478096424-2-1478098676.jpg><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p>Greene, who is a military veteran, was <a href=# rel=nofollow>arrested</a> in 2001 on charges of domestic assault, assault causing bodily injury and fourth-degree criminal mischief.
