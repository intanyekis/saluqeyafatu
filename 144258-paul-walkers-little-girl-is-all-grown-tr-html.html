I’ve never had anything like this in my life. I’ve been so transient, I’ve been on my own since I was 16. There’s a part of me who feels like I’m making up for lost time.”</p><p class=dh>Inspired by her dad’s philanthropic efforts and passion for helping people, animals, and the environment, Meadow announced the launch of the Paul Walker Foundation on what would have been his 42nd birthday.</p><p class=dh>She was 16 years old when she posted on the foundation’s website: “I love so much about him. I wanted to start this foundation because I want to share that piece of him with others. I want to share that piece of him with the world. I am tremendously proud to be launching the Paul Walker Foundation on this birthday. I can’t think of a better way to celebrate my father.”</p><p class=dh>The foundation focuses on environmental issues by “helping ocean leaders of tomorrow become beacons in fighting to protect the oceans, wildlife and ourselves.” The foundation will also provide grants as well as scholarships to both marine science students and researchers so that they become “better educated and better equipped to deal with the challenges of tomorrow.”</p><p class=dh>She also <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-6355633/Paul-Walkers-model-daughter-Meadow-celebrates-20th-birthday-fun-snap.html>said</a> on Instagram, "I found myself reflecting on his passions.
