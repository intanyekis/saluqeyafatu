The model even recently revealed she keeps a photo of the handsome NBA star as her<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> lock screen on her phone</a>! The adorable pair were rumored to be together since June 2020 — but it wasn’t until last February that they made it official and finally let fans stop wondering! And even though Devin’s rigorous schedule with professional basketball can keep them apart, he still wants to give Kendall his all. “They have a tremendous bond and really get along through laughter and he knows he will see her through the season, but he is fully aware they both have busy careers that they must nurture,” one source EXCLUSIVELY told <strong>HollywoodLife</strong>. “So, this time with her is important and he is going to take full advantage of it while he has the time.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“Things between Kendall and&nbsp;<span class=markexi11x9ch data-markjs=true data-ogac data-ogab data-ogsc data-ogsb>Devin</span>&nbsp;have definitely progressed over the past few years, and they make a really cute couple,” a second source EXCLUSIVELY shared. “Kendall is so happy with&nbsp;<span class=markexi11x9ch data-markjs=true data-ogac data-ogab data-ogsc data-ogsb>Devin</span>&nbsp;and she loves spending as much free time with him as possible.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH12e5BqZqSdnpmurbiMo5ynppWneqi%2BxJ6lZquYpL%2B1v4ycqaioXam8sXnSnqOfoZVivam706hm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
