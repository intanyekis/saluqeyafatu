That didn’t stop him from getting down on one knee and proposing to his mistress Katharina Mazepa with a big engagement diamond.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Lenny’s antics have been condemned by a number of Bravo stars, and rightly so. In many ways, his engagement is difficult and in poor taste. It’s no wonder that everyone is rooting for Lisa. <strong>Here are some of the reasons why Lenny and Katharina’s engagement is particularly clumsy and unjust to Lisa.</strong></p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Lisa and Lenny Are Still Technically Married</h2><p style=text-align:justify>The obvious problem with Lenny Hochstein’s engagement is that he is still legally married to his ex-wife. This is emphasized by Lisa’s reaction to the news. “Congrats to my current husband and his mistress on their engagement,” Lisa wrote on her Instagram stories when the news broke.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Lenny is certainly acting prematurely here. His divorce hasn’t even been formalized, and he’s already planning to marry again. Before making such a big commitment, the man should have his existing affairs in order. It’s a slap in the face for Lisa. Despite the fact that she is still Lenny’s wife, he has dumped her like trash and will not even wait till their marriage is over before moving on to his next marriage.</p><p><a href=# rel="attachment wp-att-52519"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Katharina-Mazepa-Lenny-Hochstein-1.jpg alt="Katharina Mazepa Lenny Hochstein" width=1200 height=628 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Lisa’s Family Is Taking Advantage of Lenny’s Engagement</h2><p style=text-align:justify>As if Lenny being engaged and spreading the news all over social media wasn’t awful enough, his family is using the occasion to bash Lisa. “I will be very happy that this time you are getting a woman who loves and respects you,” Lenny’s mother said in response to the revelation of her son’s engagement. “You most certainly did not have that in your previous marriage.”</p><p style=text-align:justify>Lisa is already offended by Lenny’s engagement. Now, his mother’s remark is just kicking her ex-daughter-in-law in the shins. Instead of simply celebrating her son’s joy, Lenny’s mother is reopening past wounds. Lenny has clearly moved on from Lisa, and so should his mother. If Lenny is going to insult Lisa by getting engaged before even divorcing her, his family should just let things alone.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Lenny Spent a Ton on Katharina’s Ring</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Lenny is also throwing salt into the wound by wearing the engagement ring. A diamond expert told that Katharina’s engagement ring might be valued at up to $1.5 million. The expert called the ring “breathtaking” and remarked on the work and effort that must have gone into selecting the diamond.</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by Katharina Nahlik (@katharinanahlik)</a></p><p style=text-align:justify>However, it’s not simply that Lenny spent a lot of money on the ring; he also spent WAY more on Katharina’s ring than Lisa’s. Lisa’s engagement ring was estimated to cost roughly $750,000 by the same diamond specialist. That’s half the price of Katharina’s ring, and it’s got to hurt Lisa.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Lenny appears to take every chance to emphasize that he cares more about Katharina than he ever did about Lisa. That can’t be an easy pill to swallow for Lisa, because Lenny isn’t just moving on at breakneck speed; he’s also devaluing his entire connection with Lisa. Lenny and Lisa had been married for almost a decade and had two children. Even if Lisa was to blame for their relationship’s issues, Lenny has no right to discount how essential Lisa was to him once.</p><p><a href=# rel="attachment wp-att-52520"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Katharina-Mazepa-Lenny-Hochstein.jpg alt="Katharina Mazepa Lenny Hochstein" width=1200 height=628 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><strong>You can see the latest celebrity news below:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=# rel=noopener>Who Is Crystal Williams? Former Lizzo Back Up Dancer And Pageant Winner</a></li><li><a href=# rel=noopener>Where Is Jason Aldean From? Try That In A Small Town</a></li></ul><h2 style=text-align:justify>Lisa and Lenny Share Children Together</h2><p style=text-align:justify>That takes me to the kids. The former couple has a seven-year-old son and a three-year-old daughter, and Lenny is clearly not thinking about the message he’s delivering to them. With this quick engagement and all of the complications that come with it, Lenny is telling his children that it’s okay for him to treat Lisa this way.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Now, Lenny’s son and daughter will grow up believing that it is normal to insult a spouse in this manner, or that it is acceptable to be disrespected in this manner. This could have a huge impact on Lisa and Lenny’s children’s relationships as they are older. As a father, Lenny’s behaviors create a good example for his children, and he doesn’t appear to care.</p><p style=text-align:justify>There’s a lot to dislike about Lenny Hochstein’s engagement, and it’s evident that he’s being exceedingly selfish. Lenny is enjoying his best life, but it’s at the price of others, which is a negative look for him.
