His death prompted his supporters to share their favorite lyrics from the Queens native and show just how impactful his presence was in their personal lives and in the realm of music.</p><p>Phife Dawg’s lyrics were so influential that it even made its way to a local news station in Atlanta, Ga. During a traffic report, WSB-TV’s Mark Arum effortlessly fused the A Tribe Called Quest co-founding member’s most iconic&nbsp;rhymes while leading the broadcast. Inserting his co-anchor’s name within one rhyme, Arum recites, “One for the treble, two for the bass/ You know the style Mark McKay/ Time to flip this,” among other dope lines from The Five Footer who stood tall among his peers in hip-hop.</p><p>The 45-year-old’s family also released a statement on his death, sharing, “How he impacted all our lives will never be forgotten. His love for music and sports was only surpassed by his love of God and family.”</p><p>In addition, Phife Dawg’s manager, Dion Liverpool, issued his own statement on his close friend’s passing. “Even with all his success, I have never met a person as humble as he. He taught me that maintaining a positive attitude and outlook can conquer anything. Now my brother is resting in greatness. I’m honored to have crossed paths with him. Riddim Kidz 4eva.”</p><p>View the memorable tribute below.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6W1qrLEZpuar5diwbOtxZ%2BgnGWimr2wvtNmq6uhkqrBpnmTamltbmFk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
