I’m too pregnant for this. There were too many unresolved issues between certain people, and I don’t want to spend my last couple of months pregnant in a hostile environment.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>It wasn’t until&nbsp;<strong>Aimee Hall</strong> finally convinced Nilsa to join them on vacation that Nilsa actually decided to attend. “She’s like, ‘I’m not doing this without you!'” Nilsa laughed. Season 4 of&nbsp;Floribama Shore aired earlier this year, but ended very abruptly in the middle of a vacation due to a COVID-19 scare. The cast members were forced to quarantine and stop filming before the show was actually set to end.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>The group did come together again during a reunion special, but rather than resolving issues, the sit down only brought MORE tension to the table. Nilsa’s former hookup,&nbsp;<strong>Gus Smyrnios</strong>, brought up a problem he had with her from years prior. It led to Nilsa going into season 5 on bad terms with Gus, despite previously <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>getting to a good place</a> and becoming friends again.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>“I was so caught off guard by all of it,” Nilsa revealed. “I have him blocked from everything. I just keep my distance and stay away and I don’t have to deal with it. I just kept my distance [while filming]. If he was over here, I’d go over there. We just kept our space and that was the best thing. No one else wants to be around all the fighting, so I just stayed away and let it be.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Of course, there was also the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>never-ending tension</a> between Gus and&nbsp;<strong>Jeremiah Buoni</strong>. The guys fought throughout most of seasons 3 and 4. Even though they ended up in a somewhat amicable place, the rest of the cast is still constantly on edge about whether or not <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a blow-up</a> could happen again. “You don’t necessarily know what’s going to happen [with them],” Codi Butts explained. “A certain word Jeremiah says could trigger Gus and vice versa, and next thing you know, they go at it.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Nilsa added, “That was another reason I was so hesitant going in. I was so pregnant and didn’t want them to start fighting again right in front of me and then have something happen. You never know what’s going to happen with them.” A new season of&nbsp;Floribama Shore premieres on Thurs. Sept. 16 at 8:00 p.m. on MTV, followed by Double Shot At Love.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH16e5BvZp%2Bkn6e2o63MmmSsoJ%2Bnsm66yKWqmmWgp7KousCnmrJll6rAbr%2FEmqqopl1qeqq6056pr6GVrHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
