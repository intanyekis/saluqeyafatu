While Micah struggled to decide which connection was stronger, the two men also <a href=#>had other potential partners stuck in their heads</a>. Kwame, 33, was smitten with both Micah and <a href=#><strong>Chelsea Griffin</strong></a>. At the same time, Paul, 29, eventually emotionally dumped <strong>Amber Wilder</strong> to pursue his romance with Micah.</p><p class=p1>After <a href=#>ripping off the breakup Band-Aid</a> with the Ghana native, Micah was <a href=#>all-in on her “slow-burn” romance with Paul</a> — leaving Kwame to further his romance with Chelsea, 31, to whom he eventually proposed. The environmental scientist, for his part, was <a href=#>ecstatic to pop the question to Micah</a>.</p><p class=p1>“I don’t like to know that I hurt somebody, but the right thing happened and I feel like I made the right choice,” Paul told his future fiancée <a href=#>in the Netflix pods on proposal day</a>, referring to his breakup with the flight attendant. “I really believe that. I’m happy.”</p><p class=p1>He added at the time: “When I’m in the presence of true love, I feel like I’m standing in the sun and I just feel the warmth filling every inch of my body. I think that when you find somebody who makes you feel like this, <a href=#>you need to keep them close</a>. So, this is me asking you to stay close: Will you marry me?”</p><p class=p1>The former real estate broker, after a long joking pause, accepted and <a href=#>the twosome finally met in person</a>. However, things were off to a rocky start when Micah couldn’t place her fiancé’s voice with his “dorky” exterior — and found herself drawn to ex Kwame all over again.</p><p class=p1>“I, like, love [Paul] so much but I had such a hard time equating [his voice and face], but with you I feel like it fits like a little glove,” she confessed to the former soccer player during the season 4 cast trip to Mexico in episode four. “I really do care about you as a person and the connection we made. I still, like, think about you [and] I hope the best for you. I just want you to be happy.”</p><p class=p1>In addition to <a href=#>finding love (twice) on&nbsp;<i>Love Is Blind</i></a>, the Netflix personality also gained a new circle of friends.</p><p class=p1>“I think there’s gonna be a lot that you don’t see on the show of&nbsp;amazing connections that I had with other girls&nbsp;and stuff,” Micah <a href=#>exclusively told&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly&nbsp;</i>earlier this month</a>. “[And<strong> Irina Solomonova</strong>] was what I needed at the time, and I think she’s a great person. I really do.”</p><p class=p1>Micah’s praise of the 26-year-old Russia native — who was briefly engaged to <a href=#><strong>Zack Goytowski&nbsp;</strong></a>on the show — comes after fans criticized the two women for <a href=#>acting like mean girls to the other contestant</a>s they were living with during the experiment.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“What she did for me was make me laugh and reminded me who I am&nbsp;[and] that I like to laugh,” Micah confessed to&nbsp;<i>Us</i>. “I like to joke, like, this is a really serious situation, but I don’t have to be miserable … and she gave me that.”</p><p class=p1>Scroll below to get to know the reality TV star:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BstbB5yKxkpaemmnqqv4ybo6KmlKh6rrXCmp9mpKWowKqx0Waknp2kYsCmrdKopWZsXajBor6O</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
