When <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">talking</a> to George Pennacchio of ABC7 Eyewitness News, the actor admitted that it was his wife who got him that role. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Paul <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">recounted</a> the same story to <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Chicago Tribune, saying that his wife “sensed a little kismet in the air” after seeing the audition notice for Sound of Metal.&nbsp;She even called the production team, who were considering a big name like Robert Duvall for the role, and had them watch his tape.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>'Hands of Doom'</h2><p>One of the things that helped Paul portray Joe in Sound of Metal so well was his background in sign language and music. Born to deaf parents, the actor says ASL (American sign language) is his native tongue. He grew up in the Chicago deaf community and hence carried over his experiences&nbsp;to the movie naturally.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>In fact, when talking to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Chicago Tribune</a>, Paul revealed that Darius Marder, the director&nbsp;and writer of the movie, told him that no acting was allowed for his role. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Besides his upbringing and involvement with the deaf community, Paul is also well versed in music as<span>&nbsp;the frontman for the Black Sabbath tribute ASL rock band, </span><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><span>Hands of Doom</span></a><span>.&nbsp;O</span>n top of being a musician and an actor, he&nbsp;is also a legally <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">certified interpreter</a>, a job he has&nbsp;been doing every day for over three decades.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Paul’s Daughter Is Also A Musician</h2><p>Paul started <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">signing while singing</a> as a kid because his mother, who lost her hearing at age five, missed music. He never stopped and still signs while singing for&nbsp;Hands of Doom.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>And just like him, his daughter Britta Raci is a musician. While she doesn’t make ASL music, she is part of a band called <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">It’s Butter</a>, which makes “happy music for anxious people.” <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Britta wrote her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">first song</a> when she was eight. It was about her hamster dying. She eventually applied for the Bachelor’s program at the Musician’s Institute in Hollywood, CA, and is currently the frontwoman of It’s Butter.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGipnqSRqbawutKhoKlnoJbCrXnRmpqiZaees6Z50qisp5xdpLNuucStmKVmmKm6rQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
