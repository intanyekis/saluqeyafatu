Many cite the backlash <a href=#>DeGeneres</a> received from her coming out to be the reason. In the years since the show ended, many place particular emphasis on the history-making coming out episode.</p><p>However, the rest of the cast was special and crucial to the show's success as well. What have they done since the sitcom came to an end?</p><h2 id=jack-plotnick><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Jack Plotnick</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jack Plotnick played the role of Barrett on the show. His character was one half of the frequently seen gay couple on the show, whom Ellen was friends with.

He was brought in to fill the void left by the character of Adam (played by Arye Gross), who exited the show in the third season. Spence's rougher demeanor contrasted Ellen's kind nature.

He was nominated for <a href=#>Best Supporting Actor at the Emmys</a> for four consecutive years, winning in three of them. He was later accused of assault by several women in 2017 and 2018. <a href=#>Piven denied all the allegations</a>.</p><h2 id=alice-hirson><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Alice Hirson</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Alice Hirson played Ellen's mother, Lois Morgan.

She played the character of Jenny Jackson, the mother of Annie Camden, played by Catherine Hicks. She had a recurring role in The Secret Life of the American Teenager as well as guest spots on Law & Order, ER, NYPD Blue, Judging Amy, Just Shoot Me!, and Cold Case.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>8 Child Prodigies That Ellen DeGeneres Had On Her Show...
