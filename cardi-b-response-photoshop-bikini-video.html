She even puffed her stomach out at one point to show what her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>belly really looks like</a>. “Leave my rolls alone,” she captioned the clip. During her speech, she sent a clear message to anyone making negative comments about her figure.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/cardi-b-sexy-bikini-shut-down-body-shamers-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>“I know a b*** gained some weight, because I have to make the thighs match the motherf***ing a**,” she said. “But I know you b***hes ain’t talking when y’all shaped like seals. And I know y’all n***as ain’t talking when you got sisters with bison backs and y’all mothers are shaped like walruses. I know y’all ain’t body-shaming me!” At that point, she stopped sucking in her belly for a minute, then tightened everything up again.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>To conclude the video, Cardi left fans with one hilarious and important message: “It doesn’t matter, though,” she said. “A b**** got [liposuction] money. I got lipo money!” Considering Cardi is currently one of the most successful rappers…she’s sure not wrong!</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Cardi B has been extremely vocal on social media recently. When she’s not <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>showing off</a> her bod, hair, or painful tattoo sessions, though, she’s also using her platform for good causes. The 27-year-old has been very outspoken with her support for the Black Lives Matter movement. She’s also <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>demanded justice</a> for innocent people who have been killed by police amidst the fight against police brutality in the United States.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpgZH13e5BwZpyZopm2bq6Mq5ysqJ%2BjwKZ5z6GmraejnbyxecGioqKmmWLDqrDEqGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
