Law enforcement officials were called to the actor’s Los Angeles home where he was found “unconscious in a stand-alone jacuzzi.” A statement from the Los Angeles Fire Department on Monday, October 30, revealed that Perry had been <a href=#>“deceased prior to first responder arrival.”</a> His official <a href=#>cause of death has yet to be released</a> pending a toxicology report.</p><p><a href=#>Prior to his death</a>, Perry revealed that he wanted to be remembered as<a href=#> someone who “wants to help people”</a> instead of just <a href=#>Chandler Bing</a> — the role he played on Friends from 1994 to 2004.</p><p>“The best thing about me, bar none, is that if an alcoholic or drug addict comes up to me and says, ‘Will you help me?’ I can say yes and follow up and do it,” Perry said of his legacy while appearing on the “Q with Tom Power” podcast in November 2022. “When I die, I don’t want Friends to be the first thing that’s mentioned. I want that to be the first thing that’s mentioned, and I’m going to live the rest of my life proving that.”</p><p>Perry admitted that he knew <a href=#>Friends</a> will be at the forefront of fans’ minds, but he hoped that opening the “Perry House in Malibu, a sober-living facility for men” would also be part of his legacy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Matthew-Perry-Foundation-Launches-in-the-Wake-of-Actor-Sudden-Death-2.jpg><p>“But when I die, as far as my so-called accomplishments go, it would be nice if Friends were listed far behind the things I did to try to help other people,” he said on the podcast. “I know it won’t happen, but it would be nice.”</p><p>According to the <a href=# rel=noopener>Matthew Perry Foundation’s website</a>, the group is committed to “to helping others struggling with the disease of addiction” and hopes to honor Perry’s wishes by putting his “passion for making a difference in as many lives as possible” at the forefront of the organization.</p><p>The bulk of Perry’s discussion about his substance abuse struggles came from his 2022 memoir, <a href=#>Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing</a>, where he wrote about the various ups and downs in his life.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In the book, Perry revealed that he was only “completely sober” for one season of Friends, the show’s ninth.</p><p>“You can track the trajectory of my addiction if you gauge my weight from season to season — when I’m carrying weight, it’s alcohol; when I’m skinny, it’s pills,” he wrote. “When I have a goatee, it’s lots of pills.”</p><p>Our <a href=#>special issue</a> dedicated to Matthew Perry is available now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGammaSptabDjKmcq6qpYrOwwc2dmK2hn6N6pr%2FTmpmloaOdsqV5wJ%2BrnqpdlrC1u9GsZKytlJmyr3nDnpitoF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
