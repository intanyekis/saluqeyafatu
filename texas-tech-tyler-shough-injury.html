Texas Tech quarterback Tyler Shough will be out six to eight weeks after suffering a broken fibula against West Virginia on Saturday, coach Joey McGuire told reporters Monday. Here’s what you need to know:
 Shough will have surgery on the injury Tuesday, McGuire said. Shough completed 2 of 6 passes for 3 yards, and rushed for 12 yards on four carries, before exiting the eventual 20-13 loss in the first quarter."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The 6-5, 230-pound senior has accounted for nine TDs this season. <a href=#>@Schultz_Report</a> first reported the news.</p><p>— Bruce Feldman (@BruceFeldmanCFB) <a href=#>September 24, 2023</a></p><p>The Athletic’s instant analysis:</p><h2>What this means for Texas Tech</h2><p>This is disappointing news for both Shough and Texas Tech. This is the third consecutive season that Shough, a former Oregon transfer, has had cut short or interrupted by a significant injury. In 2021, Shough broke his collarbone in the fourth game of the year and missed the rest of the season. In 2022, he suffered the same injury in the season opener but returned to finish out the final month of the season and the bowl game.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>For the Red Raiders, losing the starting quarterback after a 1-3 start is about as bad a September as they could imagine. Even though Shough has had his ups and downs this year, he operated Tech’s offense well, could make big plays and was an asset in the running game. — Khan</p><h2>Who steps in for Shough?</h2><p>The good news for Tech is that it has a talented young quarterback behind Shough in redshirt sophomore <a class=ath_autolink data-id=XOrXTXW3UyfIXlWI href=#>Behren Morton</a>. The 2021 signee is the program’s highest-rated quarterback recruit in the modern era. He plays with a ton of confidence and offensive coordinator Zach Kittley views Morton as the program’s quarterback of the future.<br>Morton comes in with some experience: He started four games last season and played nine, showing flashes of his potential and throwing for 300-plus yards in two of those starts. He struggled to get into a rhythm on Saturday while filling in for Shough, completing just 13 of 37 passes. But with time to prepare as the starter, he might be able to provide a spark to the offense when the Red Raiders host <a class=ath_autolink data-id=161 href=#>Houston</a> next week. — Khan</p><h2>What this means for the Big 12 title race</h2><p>Texas Tech was a popular sleeper pick to win the Big 12 this season in Year 2 under Joey McGuire after a strong finish to 2022. It’s hard to believe the Red Raiders are 1-3, but they came up short in close games against <a class=ath_autolink data-id=234 href=#>Wyoming</a> and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=243 href=#>Oregon</a>. The loss in Morgantown doesn’t knock Texas Tech out of the race by any means, but it needs to rally and put a win streak together soon — starting with this upcoming stretch against Houston and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=181 href=#>Baylor</a>. <a class=ath_autolink data-id=182 href=#>Texas</a>, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=178 href=#>Oklahoma</a> and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=179 href=#>Kansas</a> are all undefeated through Week 4. — Olson</p><h2>Required reading</h2><p>(Photo: Ben Queen / USA Today)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57k3FwbGpgZ3xzfJFsZmlxX2eAcMDEsZisZaSasKl507KjnqpdqLWwwcahZKKmmqq%2Funs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
