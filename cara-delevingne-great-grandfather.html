He was a Canadian-born British lawyer and politician who served as the last Chief Secretary for Ireland between 1920 and 1922.</p><p>Unlike Cara Delevingne, her <a href=# rel=noopener>great-grandfather</a> was not born in England but in Canada. He only moved to England later on after he graduated from the University of Toronto. His father was a lawyer named <strong>John Hamar Greenwood</strong> and his mother <strong>Charlotte Churchill Hubbard</strong> came from a United Empire Loyalist family with an ancestor who moved to Canada after the American Revolutionary War. His role in the Black and Tans and his politics are not uninspired, it seems.</p><p>Hamar Greenwood was a liberal and he sat as a Member of Parliament for York from 1906 to 1910 and for Sunderland from 1910 to 1922. He also served as Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department in 1919 under David Lloyd George. He was also appointed to the office of Additional Under-Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Additional Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade, and Secretary for Overseas Trade from 1919 to 1920. And he was the last Chief Secretary for Ireland. He had a seat in the Cabinet from 1920 to 1922.</p><p>It was Hamar Greenwood's time as Chief Secretary of Ireland that is looked back at with sheer revulsion and hatred. What he did hasn't left his family till now even though he's long gone. There are people who have attempted to discredit Cara Delevingne because of her great-grandfather. She might not be very fond of her great-granddad herself seeing his association with the Black and Tans horrific things he's done, the war crimes he's committed.</p><p>Hamar Greenwood was closely identified with the aggressive use of the Black and Tans and the Auxiliaries during the Irish War of Independence. Those were the regiments of the British army that were specially formed as paramilitary forces against Irish civilians from around 1920. That's not a wonderful legacy to have. Cara Delevingne's great-grandfather was second in command of the Black and Tans and the Auxiliaries.</p><p>It was under the great granddad's direction that the terrorist British army unit burnt down Cork city. When the firefighters tried to put out the blaze, they were <a href=# rel=noopener>shot</a>. It was under his command that the Black and Tans drove into Croke Park football stadium in Dublin and opened fire with machine guns into the crowd of civilians in the stands killing 14 and injuring about 100 people.</p><p>Under the command of Cara Delevingne's great grandfather Hamar Greenwood, the Black and Tans r*ped, murdered, and pillaged their way across Irish towns and villages, <a href=# rel=noopener>targeting innocent civilians</a>. He then blamed the local Irish population for everything that happened as if it was not something he was responsible for. After using the British auxiliary forces and burning the city of Cork, he had the gall to say that "Sinn Fein rebels" were responsible for that and to blame the people of Cork for burning their own city.</p><p>Cara Delevingne's great-grandfather was a Lloyd George loyalist who wanted to restore British rule in Ireland by defeating the IRA who never came clean about it. Hamar Greenwood's denials about his actions and refusal to take accountability for what he did was so frequent and outrageous that led to him being <a href=# rel=noopener>lampooned with the phras</a>e 'to tell a Greenwood.'</p><p>Irish people were only too happy when the granddad lost his seat in the 1922 general election.</p><p><strong>Also, a quick reminder for you to visit <a href=#>House & Whips</a>&nbsp;for more&nbsp;<a href=#>interesting stories</a>&nbsp;about your favorite stars.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6rApq3Nna6hoaCoe6S7zGiamqqRYrGmuMSvoKefnpp6qL7Emqtmn6KWu6WywK2fnqpf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
