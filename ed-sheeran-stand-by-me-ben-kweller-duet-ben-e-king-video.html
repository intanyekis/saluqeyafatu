To the delight of, well, everyone, Ben Kweller and Ed Sheeran recently duetted on arguably the most gorgeous song ever-- and we've got video! Thanks, internet! During his tour stop in Salt Lake City on May 20, golden throated belter&nbsp;Ed Sheeran thrilled his audience with an extra special surprise: He brought&nbsp;out his opener,&nbsp;Ben Kweller, and the two performed an acoustic duet of "Stand By Me." The heartfelt song, of course, was originally performed by&nbsp;Ben E King who, sadly, passed away just weeks ago. Such a gorgeous and touching way to honor a fallen legend! Watch the perfection right now!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ed-sheeran-ben-kweller-stand-by-me-ftr.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-1><span id=more-1724185></span></p><h3>Ed Sheeran: ‘Stand By Me’ Duet With Ben Kweller</h3><p id=content-paragraph-2>“You all know the words to this,” Ed said as he began to strum the first chords of the classic tune, “Stand By Me.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“You will sing it, you will clap, you will dance,” he added, very accurately.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Though the song has been covered by seemingly every artist under the sun, it never ceases to be gorgeous and this certainly continues to prove that. Of course, a song about standing by someone you&nbsp;care about&nbsp;lends itself quite well to a duet, which is why Ed bringing Ben out makes the whole thing even more emotionally poignant.</p><h3>Ed & Ben Sing ‘Beautiful Girls’</h3><p id=content-paragraph-5>Finally, during the last verse of “stand by me,” Ed and Ben&nbsp;even brought in the audience to sing it with them, igniting the entire room with electricity.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>The two get through the entire song with ease and utter perfection.&nbsp;And then, when we thought it couldn’t get any better, it totally does! They transition seamlessly into a guitar-driven version of&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Sean Kingston</strong></a>‘s 2007 classic, “Beautiful Girls.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>If you didn’t think that these two songs went together like bread and butter, you’d better listen to this now and prepare to be proven quite wrong!</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>What do you think of Ed and Ben’s duet?</p><p id=content-paragraph-9><strong>—&nbsp;Casey Mink</strong><br><a class=twitter-follow-button href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Follow @Casey_Mink</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWllZH12e5FqZp6cXai1prHRmqVmq6SWu6V5wbJkpp1dl7KvecqwnKWklad6pcHErWSbnZ5ism63yKeeZq6ZmbKwew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
