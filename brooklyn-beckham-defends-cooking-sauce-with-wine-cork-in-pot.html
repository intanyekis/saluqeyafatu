Brooklyn Beckham clapped back at haters trolling him for making pasta sauce with a wine cork in the pot.
“Daddy day care ❤️,” Beckham, 24, wrote via Instagram late last month alongside two photos of him cooking a Bolognese sauce while carrying his dog in a sling across his chest.
The aspiring chef quickly came under fire when eagle-eyed fans notice that there was a wine cork sitting in the pot on the stove."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

This is the only way to have soft meat.”</p><p>The cork debate <a href=#>isn’t the first time Beckham has raised eyebrows</a> with his recipes on social media. In January, the model received backlash after <a href=#>he shared a video making a creamy truffle tagliatelle pasta</a>.</p><p>“In my kitchen, no such thing as too much truffle,” <a href=#><strong>David</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Victoria Beckham</strong></a>’s eldest son captioned the clip, which showed him adding truffle to the dish and extra black truffle shavings as garnish.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Brooklyn was slammed in the comments section, with one user claiming he was “out of touch” for using such an “expensive” ingredient when <a href=#>the cost of living is so high</a>.</p><p>“These people live in a different world most people can barely afford to eat at the moment and this kid is waffling on about truffle,” a second comment read.</p><p>Some of <a href=#>the U.K. native</a>’s fans came to his aid, with one user, writing: “Some comments are out of this world. I cannot afford truffle either but still I enjoyed the video and really don’t care who and how he bought it. What about unfollowing him instead of writing mean comments.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmn6efmXyvsdasZpuqn6S4rcXNZpmem5udrq55w56dnqaUqHqku86koKefXaiutq%2FEZq6irJhixKq6xGaaqKqbYravec%2Boq2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
