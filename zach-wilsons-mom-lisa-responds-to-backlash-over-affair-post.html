Taking to her Instagram Stories on Wednesday — the same day Jets GM Joe Douglas said the quarterback was granted permission to seek a trade — Lisa Wilson shared a video with husband Mike at the gym, joking the two were having an affair.
“I’m having an affair with the hot guy from the gym, who also happens to be my husband,” Lisa wrote, adding a winking face emoji."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

For real. They’re not funny. They destroy families and children’s lives.”</p><p>Lisa, who has 157,000 followers on Instagram — where she often shares advice for women balancing marriage and family — explained that wasn’t her intention.</p><p>“Um…. I don’t think i made fun of it,” she wrote back. “We weren’t good. We were tired and disconnected. So I thought why do people have affairs. So I did all the same things to try to bring a spark back. Flirting, sexy texts. And it worked. I’m trying to promote finding that fire with your person.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Lisa Wilson posted a wedding photo in a separate Instagram slide. <span class=credit>Instagram/Lisa Wilson</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Lisa Wilson. <span class=credit>Instagram/Lisa Wilson</span></figure><p>Lisa also wrote a note over the screengrab, stating in part how she’s “just a mom and wife trying to help women live their best life.”</p><p>“I’m not for everyone and that’s ok. I’m just a mom and wife trying to help women live their best life. Sharing things that work for me,” she wrote.</p><p>The Utah native then shared a photo from her and Mike’s wedding day and further explained her post.</p><p>“If you’re new here….
