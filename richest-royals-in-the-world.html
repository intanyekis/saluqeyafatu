The Empire violently exploited such nations, leading to decades of socioeconomic devastation and suffering.</p><p>"In the past few years, public scrutiny and accusations of racism perpetuated within the royal family have forced them to reckon with their colonial history. Most recently, though, the passing of the Queen reignited debates about reparations and the legacy of colonialism."</p><p>Qatar’s Thani clan and Kuwait’s Sabah family pale in comparison to the trillion-dollar riches of the House of Saud; to the west are the precious collections of Liechtenstein’s kings and queen and the British Windsors.</p><p>Using their land resources, the Chakri dynasty and Bolkiah house have prospered on their respective continents.</p><p>It is hard to estimate royal wealth for myriad reasons, but it is incalculable.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img

sourced from different places, including the Sovereign Grant, which caters for the official duties, maintenance of royal residences, and investments.</p><p>Tallying the House of Windsor's fortune is complicated on one level by standard royal secrecy, and the tendency of monarchies not to disclose the extent of their wealth.</p><p>It would be remiss, however, not to mention longstanding controversies over how antiquities in the purported possession of the House of Windsor were obtained, and whether such valuables ought to be returned.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top

nothing to hide, she should tell us what artefacts she owns," and it focused upon <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">royal transparency and illicitly obtained artifacts</a>.</p><p>A subheading prefaced the article with a blunt summary of its central argument:</p><p>The royal family has a history of acquiring looted objects, so its exemption from a law protecting cultural heritage raises questions.</p><p>The Guardian provided a litany of potentially questionable items in the royal family's collection, and once again summarized the issue at hand:</p><p>... like museums, the British royal family is also clearly at risk of receiving loans or gifts of illicit antiquities, of artworks stolen during the Holocaust, or of colonial loot.</p><p>Due diligence and transparency is of course an ethical responsibility in both cases. And then there’s the question of the Royal Collections.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom
