In fact, the show became so well known that almost two decades after the show ceased production it was adapted into a major movie that starred <a href=#>Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson</a>. On top of that, a lot of former fans are interested in <a href=#>what has happened to Baywatch’s original cast</a> over the last twenty years and how much money they are worth today.</p><h2 id=jeremy-jackson-rsquo-s-net-worth-is-300-000><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Jeremy Jackson’s Net Worth is $300,000</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When most people look back on Baywatch’s legacy, they are bound to think of the show’s adult stars since it is easy to forget that the series also focused on a character who was a child. Brought to life by Jeremy Jackson, Hobie Buchannon is the son of Baywatch’s main character who was portrayed by David Hasselhoff. Unfortunately, just like a lot of other <a href=#>former child stars who have been arrested</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jackson spent time behind bars</a> after taking a plea deal when he was charged with stabbing someone. Seemingly on a much better track now, the former child star runs Jeremy Jackson Fitness, is in amazing shape, and he is worth $300,000 according to celebritynetworth.com.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>20 Former Disney Stars Who Got In Trouble With The Law</a></span></p><h2 id=shawn-weatherly-rsquo-s-net-worth-is-1-million><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Shawn Weatherly’s Net Worth Is $1 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though most people associate the early days of Baywatch with Pamela Anderson, it wasn’t until the show’s third season that she joined the cast. Instead, the first season starred some actors that a lot of people have since forgotten about including Shawn Weatherly. A former Miss USA and Miss Universe, Weatherly also notably starred in Police Academy 3: Back in Training. Over the last twenty years, Weatherly has only taken two roles according to IMDb. Despite that, Weatherly is worth $1 million according to celebritynetworth.com although the fact that she is married to the president of a biotech research company likely plays a role in that.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Would Pamela Anderson Ever Be Interested In A 'Baywatch' Reboot?</a></span></p><h2 id=peter-phelp-rsquo-s-net-worth-is-1-5-million><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Peter Phelp’s Net Worth Is $1.5 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During the first season of Baywatch, Peter Phelps portrayed Trevor Cole, an arrogant lifeguard whose life gets turned upside down once his confidence was shaken. An Australian actor, Phelps also starred in shows in his home country including Stingers and Sons and Daughters and he worked consistently for many years. As a result, Phelps is worth $1.5 million according to celebnetworths.com but reliable sources have yet to confirm that figure.</p><h2 id=erika-eleniak-rsquo-s-net-worth-is-4-million><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Erika Eleniak’s Net Worth Is $4 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the year 1989, Erika Eleniak’s career took off in a big way as she joined the cast of Baywatch and posed for Playboy at only 19-years old. Unlike most of the actors who starred in Baywatch’s first season, Eleniak stayed with the show after its NBC cancellation as she was a part of the series’ first three seasons. On top of that, Eleniak starred in movies like The Blob, Under Siege, and The Beverly Hillbillies and she continues to find acting work off and on to this day. For all of those reasons, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eleniak is worth $4 million</a> according to celebritynetworth.com.</p><h2 id=parker-stevenson-rsquo-s-net-worth-is-10-million><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Parker Stevenson’s Net Worth Is $10 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When the first season of Baywatch debuted on television, almost all of the show’s stars were mostly unknown. However, casting Parker Stevenson as Craig Pomeroy was a little bit of a bigger deal for the show’s producers. After all, Stevenson had been a memorable part of shows like The Hardy Boys and Falcon Crest before Baywatch began. Even though Stevenson left Baywatch after the show’s first season, he would go on to appear in a long list of shows and movies. On top of that, Stevenson married celebrity chef Lisa Schoen which also has advanced his fortunes. For all of those reasons, Stevenson has amassed a $10 million fortune according to celebritynetworth.com.</p><h2 id=david-hasselhoff-rsquo-s-net-worth-is-10-million><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>David Hasselhoff’s Net Worth Is $10 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After starring in Knight Rider from 1982 to 1986, David Hasselhoff went on to headline the first ten seasons of Baywatch. In addition to being a major TV star for all of those years, Hasselhoff also notably had a highly successful music career internationally. More recently, Hasselhoff served as a judge for competition shows like America's Got Talent and Britain's Got Talent. One of those rare actors who has proven to be a survivor in Hollywood, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hasselhoff is worth $10 million</a> according to celebritynetworth. Even though that is a staggering amount of money for most people, it arguably is surprising that Hasselhoff isn’t worth more based on all of the success he enjoyed during his career.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Here's Why David Hasselhoff Doesn't Care About His Net Worth Anymore</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0ecGasLCZpJi1tHnOq6CgoZ6WuW6vwKyrZqGjYsSwvtOhZGtoYmd8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
