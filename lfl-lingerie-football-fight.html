If there was ever a sport to destroy the stereotype that women are less violent than men, the Legends Football League is definitely the one to do it.

Amanda Hogan, defensive back for Omaha Heart, held on to the Pittsburgh receiver a little longer than necessary, resulting in some heated words between the players. Then a few of the sidelined Pittsburgh players rushing to her defense, including injured running back Sonya Osselborn. When Sonya got a little too in her face, Amanda decided to settle words with fists, landing a right cross that put Sonya flat on her ass.</p><p>The scene ends with the league’s male referees breaking up the fight and separating the two teams.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Pittsburgh would eventually rally after the outburst and defeat Omaha 21 to 20.

Historically the league has let these sort of things slide.</p><p>The Legends Football League remains a controversial subject. While many believe the league does a valuable service in bringing a typically male dominated sport&nbsp;to female players, many more remain critical of the league’s uniforms - or lack thereof. The distinctly bare-skin motif for all the league’s teams is physically risky and has resulted in far more cuts and scrapes to players.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before the league’s rebranding in 2013 - it used to be the Lingerie Football League - players were only allowed to wear lingerie, but after numerous complaints from players the league finally allowed protective sports gear to be worn instead. That said, the uniforms still bare as much skin as possible, and the push-up bras leave no question that the league is exploiting sex to sell tickets.</p><p><strong>NEXT: <a href=#>THE HOTTEST LFL PLAYERS OF ALL TIME</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmm62qr3ytsstmo6Kml5q%2FqrGMn6aorJKWua15xaKeoaxf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
