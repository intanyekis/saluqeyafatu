His past relationships with famous female celebrities prove these rumors are to be taken with a grain of salt. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>His Recent Breakup</h2><p>In February, DaniLeigh&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">took</a>&nbsp;to Instagram stories&nbsp;to announce that she was no longer in a relationship.</p><p>She and the ‘Masterpiece’ rapper first met while working together on DaBaby’s music video for ‘Bop.’ The singer was co-choreographing the video.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Not too long after this, DaBaby returned the favor and was featured on DaniLeigh’s single, ‘Levi High.’ The supposed couple never really confirmed their relationship, but DaBaby’s ex-girlfriend and baby mother, Meme, chimed in.</p><p>She exposed the truth via social media by uploading their private conversations in a series of now-deleted screenshots.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>It was revealed that they were indeed involved with each other. Fans were angry and called the singer a home-wrecker. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>A few months after the social media blow-up, she posted a photo with DaBaby, confirming their relationship.&nbsp;</p><p>After that, the star would often retweet pictures of them, post snapshots on her Instagram. But almost a year later, the couple reportedly split.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2>His Baby Mama</h2><p>DaBaby has been on and off with Meme for as long as he’s been around. She has taken him back frequently, even after some of his rumored and short-lived relationships.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Although he and MeMe were never married, they have <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">kids</a> together.&nbsp;</p><p>The rapper has a stepson with MeMe, who was born from her previous relationship. DaBaby has been around for most of his&nbsp;stepson’s life and became a father figure to the boy.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>In 2017, DaBaby welcomed his first biological child, a daughter, with Meme.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the past few years, he’s shared casual pictures of her, but the parents prefer to keep both their children out of the spotlight. Both children are a complete mystery to the public; even their name has not been revealed. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>That said, fans believe DaBaby will still be together with Meme.
