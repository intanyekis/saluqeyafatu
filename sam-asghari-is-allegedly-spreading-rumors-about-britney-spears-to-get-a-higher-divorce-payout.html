Furthermore, it’s claimed that she had a romantic involvement with at least one male employee.</p><p>One informant even told the publication that there exists a video showing Britney and the staff member in a situation deemed "compromising."</p><p>The fresh accusations against Britney surfaced following her recent attention-grabbing event - a "divorce party." During this gathering, she posted multiple social media updates where she was seen celebrating with bare-chested men. One video displayed a mystery man playfully licking her leg, while another clip captured Britney being lifted by a group of shirtless men by the poolside.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sam has denied allegations that he’s planning to challenge the prenup, but reports say the Iranian-born actor was only entitled to $1 million after two years of marriage, whereas he filed for divorce after 14 months. The prenup also waived his rights to Britney’s music catalog and he’s currently not on the deed of the house.</p><p>Even if Sam is hoping the rumors about Britney’s infidelity work in his favor, he’s already getting financial support from Britney – the <a href=#>pop star recently agreed to pay for his $10,000 apartment</a>. Their divorce remains ongoing.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Caitlyn Jenner Reunites With Kardashian Family For New Docuseries</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTAormMmqqgoJGntm610maYpaSVnLKluNhmqqmqlZaxqrrGZqmupZ%2BnwG6twaisrWWSp7a1usSyZKyolZa%2FtHnTqGSgnaRirm60yKCfnqpdmba3u9GcnGaoka68tsCO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
