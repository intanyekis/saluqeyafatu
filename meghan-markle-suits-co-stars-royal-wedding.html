Most fans watched the former <i>Suits</i> star exchange vows with Prince Harry on television, but a few of her co-stars were inside St. George’s Chapel to watch it firsthand. Here’s what they said about Markle’s big day.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><i>Suits</i> stars Sarah Rafferty and Gabriel Macht were both invited to attend the royal wedding. They were among 600 lucky guests to receive an invite to the historic event, many of whom were celebrities and members of the royal family. Looking back at the wedding, Rafferty, who starred alongside Markle as Donna Paulsen on the show, recalled how the entire ceremony was special to behold.</p><p>“It was a wonderful moment to get to see [Meghan] on that day and in that moment. It was special,” she explained.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>MEGHAN MARKLE'S EX-HUSBAND GETS ENGAGED WEEKS AFTER ROYAL WEDDING</a></strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>People</i></a>, Rafferty’s favorite moment of the wedding was when Markle walked down the aisle by herself and Prince Charles reached her halfway. Markle’s father, Thomas Markle, could not make it to the wedding because of poor health.</p><p>Instead of having her mom walk her down the aisle, Markle decided to walk most of the way by herself.</p><p>As far as Macht is concerned, his favorite moment of the wedding came during the reception. The actor, who plays Harvey Spector on <i>Suits</i>, revealed that he was surprised when Elton John took the stage during lunch and sang “I’m Still Standing.” Macht thought it was incredible to watch John perform and be a part of an amazing love story.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kensington Palace has confirmed that John did sing at the reception, which was hosted inside of Windsor Castle by Queen Elizabeth. In addition to singing “I’m Still Standing,” John performed a number of his greatest hits, including “Tiny Dancer,” which was dedicated to Markle.</p><p>John, of course, has deep ties with the royal family. He was a close friend of Harry’s mom, Princess Diana, and sang “Candle In the Wind” during her funeral. Harry personally asked John to sing at the reception.</p><p>Rafferty and Macht, meanwhile, have witnessed Meghan Markle tie the knot in the past. The two attended her on-screen wedding to Patrick J. Adams, who played her love interest Mike Ross on the show. Adams was also in attendance at the ceremony on May 19, 2018.</p><p>The final season of <i>Suits</i> begins July 18 on USA.</p><p><strong>NEXT: <a href=#>MEGHAN MARKLE FORCED TO TAKE ROYAL LESSONS</a></strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nnZq0qa3NZqSaqpuhsm6%2F1KKrrGWTpHq0wMCrqmaqn66urXnWnpudoZ6cfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
