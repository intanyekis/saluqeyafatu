You combine a great (or at least popular movie/television series) with an adult movie setting and like magic you have something that’s both entertaining as well as erotic. I’m not certain, but guessing this is what <a href=#>Van Halen</a> meant when they&nbsp;wrote “Best of Both Worlds.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The rules for making a skin flick parody are not set in stone, or well defined at all. Most of the time major characters are left out and the plot doesn’t follow the original story line. Sometimes, only the title is a parody while the actual “flick” is pretty straight forward porn.</p><p>Honorable mentions go to Gay of Thrones, XXX Men, Buffy the Vampire Layer and One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Breast. All of these at least made an attempt to parody the movie or television show they were portraying. I should also mention Pulp Friction, as you may have guessed, the gimp part alone is worth a viewing.</p><p>Let’s get to this. We’ve got parodies of <a href=#>The Situation</a>, E.T. and even <a href=#>Jerry Seinfeld</a>. Is nothing sacred these days? No, not in the world of skin flick parodies; here are the greatest skin flick parodies of all time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=10-jersey-score><strong>10. Jersey Score</strong></h2><p>This one must really make the fellas of Jersey Shore squirm. This MTV reality show is parodied as a gay adult movie. Dean Coxx is the star of the movie, playing The Stimulation who leads a group of muscle-bound-tanned meatheads on an adventure while on Spring Break. The casting really deserves credit as the characters are comparable to the meatheads that starred on the actual show. The biggest cop-out I’ve seen is that there was no Snooki – it’s the first time I’ve seen such disappointment in her omission. I’ve only seen the trailer so I’m not sure if there is a scene where The Stimulation has an erection and runs into a wall. I’m just going to assume that scene was left on the cutting room floor.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=9-e3-the-extra-testicle><strong>9. E3: The Extra Testicle</strong></h2><p>How the director of this movie got a budget for this is mind-boggling to me. Is there anyone who looks at E.T. and gets that special feeling down below? Don’t answer that if you do! The movie follows “E.T.” after he lands on our planet looking for love. You can imagine the sticky situations E.T. finds himself in that result in full nudity. By the way, this totally treads on bestiality to me. Is it just me? The most shocking thing of this movie isn’t the alien sex, but that somehow the film was marketed as a science fiction comedy. Okay, that’s not the most shocking thing, definitely alien sex, yeah that’s always going to open the eyes wider than intended.</p><p></p><h2 id=8-seinfeld-a-xxx-parody><strong>8. Seinfeld: A XXX Parody</strong></h2><p>Obviously there is endless content to pull from. Do you center the movie around “the contest” or what about the threesomes? In this movie, Kramer is known as the p*rn Nazi and is making his own movies. One of the stars is a guy named Buck paired with Gorge’s fiancee, Suzanne. Of course there is an adult shoot and missing tape and yadda, yadda, yadda… the story unfolds. Special props to <a href=#>James Deen</a>, the legend who plays a good Jerry Seinfeld, he brought back the role recently for the movie Comedians in Cars Getting Sex (a spoof on Jerry’s Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee). What’s the deal with all of these sex tapes starring me?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=7-naporneon-dynamite><strong>7. Naporneon Dynamite</strong></h2><p>This one is really to be enjoyed by anyone that enjoyed the original movie, Napoleon Dynamite. If you didn’t like it, stay away from the parody – you have been warned. All of the strange quotes that got put into the hipster playbook are in the parody as well. Every time someone gets nailed you can expect a “sweet” will follow at some point. The story revolves around Naporneon and his quest to lose his virginity. It goes without saying; this is not based on a true story. Remember that dude named Paco? Yeah, well, he is still running for class president; however, now get gets to bang girls for votes. Sweet.</p><p></p><h2 id=6-womb-raider><strong>6. Womb Raider</strong></h2><p>Now we really need to start off with the original. Tomb Raider, starring <a href=#>Angelina Jolie</a>, had a lot of moments that could be considered foreplay to eroticism, just didn’t quite make it there. So it makes perfect sense for someone to make Womb Raider, with the lead character Cara Loft who meets a doctor named Dr. Scrotus. I love skin flicks with a sense of humor and this one scores high in this area. If you were a fan of the original, and Jolie, you will enjoy this one and finally be able to finish that fantasy you started many years ago.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=5-missionary-position-impossible><strong>5. Missionary Position: Impossible</strong></h2><p>This one checks a lot of boxes. Good title: check. Good actors: check. Good story line: sort of check. The movie stars Angelica Sin who meets Dick Blowhard, who wants to be President and remove adult films&nbsp;from the U.S. Sin leads a group of agents set to show Blowhard isn’t the man he says he is, exposing him in the process. Does Blowhard end up having a lot of sex? I think that’s a pretty safe bet. Is Sin involved? I think it’s pretty safe to check another box. Full disclosure: I have not seen this movie, but I did see there was a Missionary Position: Impossible 2 so I think that’s a pretty good sign.</p><p></p><h2 id=4-forrest-hump><strong>4. Forrest Hump</strong></h2><p>Sometimes the size of the movie you are parodying plus a great name gets you far, especially when marketed correctly. I still remember where I was (eating at a Burger King) when I heard there was a skin flick titled Forrest Hump. The original movie made me laugh a couple times and this title did the same. As far as story line there are not any Nixon scenes, but there is a ping pong scene. Just kidding, that would be weird, I think. After each “scene” the sweaty characters take a break and enjoy a Dr. Pepper. Again, I kid…</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=3-edward-penishands><strong>3. Edward Penishands</strong></h2><p>Let’s face it; there isn’t a lot that hasn’t been done in the world of skin flicks. So when someone looks at a movie of a person with scissors as hands and thinks “penis hands,” well, you really have to tip your hat to this person. The storyline is there is a woman who makes a living traveling and selling dildos. She comes across this man with penis hands and takes him home. He then has sex with her daughter. You kind of have to expect that to happen when you bring a man with penis hands home. It goes without saying…</p><p></p><h2 id=2-t--s-a-wonderful-life><strong>2. T--s a Wonderful Life</strong></h2><p>We know the original and yes, the title is fabulous! The guardian angel is naked, of course. Her name is Hortense and just like the American classic, it's Christmas time and she is spreading the good word. How does she do this? By helping out someone show what life would be like if they had not existed. Note: There are not any cameos by Jimmy Stewart. Sorry, but I thought you should know this up front. You can insert pretty much any joke on how Hortense “earns her wings” as long as its erotic, you will be spot on.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=1-shaving-ryan-s-privates><strong>1. Shaving Ryan’s Privates</strong></h2><p>Man, it’s takes guts to parody this movie. This WWII war drama parody is predominately gay and definitely keeps the bunk hopping throughout the flick. Why is this number one? First, the name is solid. Secondly, given his movies often make it to this genre, there’s always a chance <a href=#>Tom Hanks</a> decides to cut out the middle man. No, that doesn’t happen and probably will never happen, but what if? Finally, the shocking factor of taking this sad, horrifying tale and turning into a male-on-male fest. This is the type of movie you never rent with others, you go back the next day to check it out for yourself.</p><p><strong>Sources: <a href=#>IFC</a>, <a href=#>Moviepilot</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmZqaF2cv6at056qrWWjoLavecWloJyjXaWus7vDopysZZ%2BbeqK4y2aroqWVZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
