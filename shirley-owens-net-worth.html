She met her fellow The Shirelles members and began performing at school dances and talents shows, laying the foundation for her net worth. Their breakthrough came in 1958 when they signed with “Tiara Records”, under the management of Florence Greenberg, the label owner. Their first single “I Met Him On A Sunday” released in 1959 became a local hit. Subsequently, Florence sold the group’s rights to “Decca Records”, but their subsequent releases did not achieve chart success, leading to the group being dropped by Decca Records. As Florence remained their manager, she signed them with her new record label “Scepter Records”. Their first full-length album “Tonight’s The Night” was released in 1961, featuring their hit song “Will You Love Me Tomorrow”. This marked the rise in Shirley’s net worth, as the group continued to release numerous successful tracks. Their second album, “Baby It’s You”, released a year later, spawned the hit songs “Baby It’s You” and “Soldier Boy”.</p><p>The Shirelles released a total of 11 studio albums, including “Foolish Little Girl” (1963), “Happy And In Love” (1971), and their final studio release “Eternally, Soul”(1973). In 1975, Shirley departed from the group to pursue a solo career. Her debut album, “With A Little Help From My Friends”, was released the same year, under the pseudonym “Lady Rose”. However, her solo career did not live up to its potential, leading Shirley to tour the world with other music groups. In 2000, Shirley performed at the Doo Wop 51 PBS special and currently tours the world with a group of musicians under the name “Shirley Alston Reeves And Her Shirelles”.</p><p>Her career has been successful, with numerous awards including the Pioneer Award, recognizing the group’s contribution to music, presented by Rhythm And Blues Foundation. Additionally, they were featured on Rolling Stone’s list of 100 Greatest Artists Of All Time at number 76. Furthermore, a street in Passaic, their hometown, was named after the group, The Shirelles Boulevard.</p><p>Regarding her personal life, Shirley has been married twice, with limited information available about these marriages, except for the fact that she changed her last name to Alston and later Reeves.</p><ul class=tabs-menu><li>Structural Info</li><li>Facts</li><li>Filmography</li></ul><table><tbody><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Shirley Owens</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$3 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>June 10, 1941</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Henderson, North Carolina, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Singer</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Passaic High School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>United States of America</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Barbara Alston</td></tr><tr><td>Nicknames</td><td>Shirley Owens Alston , Shirley Alston Reeves , Owens, Shirley , Shirley Alston , Alston, Shirley</td></tr><tr><td>IMDB</td><td>www.imdb.com/name/nm0716297</td></tr><tr><td>Awards</td><td>Rock And Roll Hall of Fame (1996)</td></tr><tr><td>Record Labels</td><td>Scepter Records, Decca Records, RCA Records, Bell Records, Tiara Records</td></tr><tr><td>Albums</td><td>“Baby It`s You” (1962), “Tonight`s The Night” (1961),“Foolish Little Girl” (1963), “Happy And In Love” (1971), “Eternally, Soul” (1973)</td></tr><tr><td>Music Groups</td><td>“The Shirelles” (1957-1975), “Shirley Alston Reeves And Her Shirelles”</td></tr></tbody></table><table class=interesting_facts><tbody><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Attended Passaic High School in Passaic, New Jersey.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>She and the Shirelles were inducted into the 2014 New Jersey Hall of Fame in the Arts and Entertainment Category.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Older sister of Barbara Alston and Barbara Alston.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Was part of the female group The Shirelles, which consisted of Shirley, Micki Harris, Doris Kenner-Jackson and Beverly Lee.
