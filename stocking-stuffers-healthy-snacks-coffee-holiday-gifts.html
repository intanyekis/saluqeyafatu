They can almost be harder to shop for, especially if you’re looking for a variety of things. It has to be smaller than your main gift, but you still want it to bring out the same big smile from your recipient.</p><p>Two items you really can’t go wrong with? <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Snacks</a> and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">coffee</a>. You want them to be special though; you don’t just want to buy the same exact stuff your recipient picks up while in the checkout line at the convenience store. You want it to be healthy but yummy, fancy but easy. You want <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Shār Snacks</a> and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">STRONG Coffee</a>!</p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><ul><li><strong>Get <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Shār Snacks</a> at LifeToGo with free shipping!

Shār Snacks is a farm-to-table snack food company that responsibly sources its ingredients right from small family farms. The brand’s Impossibly Good Trail Mix pretty much describes itself. This trail mix is 100% organic, vegan, palo, gluten-free and non-GMO, leaving out all of the preservatives and added sugars or sweeteners. But the taste? Just amazing!</p><p>You can grab this <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Impossibly Good Trail Mix</a> either in tubes, packets or a large glass jar. The Holiday Gift set even comes in a gift box for you, while the glass jar is decorated with a ribbon!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/strong-coffee.jpg><ul><li><strong>Get <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Shār Snacks</a> at LifeToGo with free shipping!

It’s “the world’s premier on-the-go coffee drink mix.” Each packet contains premixed powder with instant organic coffee, grass-fed collagen protein and MCT oil, meaning it’s out to fuel both your mind and body. The best part? There’s no blending or brewing required. Just pour it into a cup of hot or cold water and give it a quick stir!</p><p>There are four flavors of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">STRONG Coffee</a> available at LifeToGo, and each comes in a pack of 15 single-serve packets. Black is self-explanatory, Daybreaker is a dark and unsweetened latte flavor, Sunrise Matcha brings the superfood powder into the mix and Morning Fix Latte is “creamy, sweet and nutritionally charged.” All of the above, please!</p><ul><li><strong>Get <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Shār Snacks</a> at LifeToGo with free shipping!
