The duo have shared the screen in several films, and each time, their chemistry has been nothing short of electric. From the intensity of Vijaypath to the passion in Takshak, their on-screen collaborations have left audiences wondering if there's more than just acting prowess at play.</p><p><h2>Tabu and Ajay Devgn's alleged affair</h2></p><p>In an interaction with media portal, the Haider actress once opened up about how Ajay Devgn is one of her close friends while growing up and why she is still single. She said, "He was my cousin Sameer Arya’s neighbour and close buddy, a part of my growing up years and that has laid the foundation of our relationship. When I was young, Sameer and Ajay would spy on me, follow me around and threaten to beat up any boys who are caught talking to me. They were the big bullies and if I am single today, it is because of Ajay. I hope he repents and regrets what he did."</p><p>Going forward, in a playful banter, the Andhadhun actress quipped about requesting Ajay to play matchmaker for her.</p><p>Tabu and Ajay Devgn have not just been co-stars but have also collaborated on a professional level. Ajay Devgn has produced films featuring Tabu, further fueling the belief that there might be a deeper connection between the two beyond the screen.</p><p><h2>Tabu and Ajay Devgn's professional front</h2></p><p>Meanwhile, on the work front, Tabu was recently seen in Vishal Bharadwaj's Khufiya and it received mixed reviews from the audience. The film is currently streaming on Netflix. On the other hand, Ajay Devgn was last seen in Bholaa. Currently, the Bollywood actor is gearing up for Rohit Shetty's highly-anticipated film Singham Again.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbXMnqqnp6ejsri%2FjZympmeVo8GmvtOaoKellaPBbrrEsKpomp%2BhubrDzqibaK%2BYmrtuwMCbrGaanJa6prCMmqGasV2ZsrezzWadqKpdnbKzedKipaCklWLAta3TrqpmoJ%2Blsm60xGapnqiVo8G0ecCnm2aqlZy%2FpsDSZpirrJmYuaZ5kGlrcm5hZX5y</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
