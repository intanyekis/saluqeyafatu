At the end of the day Hmm. I didn’t go to SA for four months to plan a wedding I went there for work! I was working my b*t off every single day in Johannesburg.</p><p>“Was hosting a lot of gigs there too. Did a lot of shoot covers, radio/TV interviews. Most importantly to also start my household essentials cleaning company there in Johannesburg. Which will be launching here in Nigeria soon too,” she wrote.</p><p>According to Annie, the show’s production put her motherhood and career life on the back burner in favor of focusing solely on her marriage, exposing her to internet derision.</p><p>“I gave them the mother, I gave them the tasking career woman and entrepreneur and finally I gave them the wife. Told my story as genuine as I could. In all honesty, I gave my whole me to it. Sadly none of those scenes made it to the show, took out my work. The main role I play as a mother in my children’s lives and only put out my love in marriage. Regardless all in all I am happy about the opportunity,” she wrote.</p><p>Read also: <a href=# rel=bookmark>Young Comedian Emmanuella Surprises Mom with New House (Photos)</a></p><p>Annie said that they had no intention of celebrating their 10th anniversary by renewing their vows, but that it just happened.
