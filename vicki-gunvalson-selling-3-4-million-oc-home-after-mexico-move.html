She announced she closed on her “vacation/retirement house” in May.</p><p>“Other than being with my children, grandchildren and [my fiancé Steve Lodge] it’s one of my happiest and fondest memories and one of my parents’ favorite destinations,” Gunvalson wrote about Puerto Vallarta, noting she’s been traveling there for more than three decades. “I know some of you may think it’s wrong, especially in the state of the world, but for me it immediately gives me hope and peace that things will resume to a new sense of normal soon. I won’t be visiting there until I’m able, but as of today I own a home that makes me happy.”</p><p>Two months later, Gunvalson confirmed she officially moved into her new pad.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I took a leap of faith, I ended up closing on a condo last month and I got here last night.
