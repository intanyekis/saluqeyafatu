This means photos, videos, interviews, and, in the case of Jenny Slate and Chris Evans, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">movies and podcasts that they've done together</a>.</p><p>And we thought it was tough getting rid of all the social media photos we took with our ex-bae. Yikes! How tough was it on them, though? How long did their relationship last? We figured it was time to put a real relationship timeline together.</p><h2 id=they-met-when-jenny-slate-was-still-married><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>They Met When Jenny Slate Was Still Married</span></h2><p>Although we all know how that ended, it’s still important to start at the beginning,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">to get the full Jenny Slate/Chris Evans timeline</a>. Jenny Slate and her then-husband had been together for a while when Chris Evans came into her life. Slate and Evans officially met on the Gifted set, after running into each other throughout the audition process. It was there that things between them started to really blossom.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=but-we-re-pretty-sure-nothing-happened><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>But We’re Pretty Sure Nothing Happened...</span></h2><p>Blossom in a purely <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">platonic sense</a>, of course! Nothing outside of the bounds of the movie happened on set. Sure, they enjoyed some weekly game nights and talked about each other on social media a few times, but that doesn’t mean anything. After all, Jenny was still married at this point. We’re pretty sure nothing happened, but then a certain podcast episode came out and we started to question it.</p><h2 id=except-for-an-eyebrow-raising-co-podcast-appearance><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Except For An Eyebrow-Raising Co-Podcast Appearance</span></h2><p>The podcast in question happened in April of 2016. The two of them signed on to participate in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Anna Faris’s Unqualified podcast</a>, talking about their life, as well as work which would be coming out soon.</p><p>Now, for us regular folks, going on a podcast with someone else seems normal. But to have both of them on there, bantering like they’ve known each other for decades? No way is that innocent...there’s definitely something deeper under there.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jenny-divorced-and-immediately-they-were-dating><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Jenny Divorced And IMMEDIATELY They Were Dating</span></h2><p>Surprise, surprise! Jenny Slate and her first husband divorced and Chris Evans snapped into the picture immediately. Like, we’re not even sure the ink was dry on the forms before Slate and Evans were spotted out and about together. These two people just seemed to fit each other. They knew that they were meant to be together and they pursued it wholeheartedly, like Kim and Kanye. We can’t fault them for that.</p><h2 id=an-official-red-carpet-appearance-shortly-followed><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>An Official Red Carpet Appearance Shortly Followed</span></h2><p>Of course, it’s not official without a red carpet appearance. This is more of a celebrity-specific milestone, which is why it’s an important piece of the timeline. Halfway through 2016, the two of them rock a red carpet together...and the whole world falls in love. 'Slevans' (okay, okay...nobody actually called them that) turned heads with their bright smiles and pure love. They were totally #couplegoals for a while.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=and-after-a-year-it-was-done><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>And After A Year It Was Done</span></h2><p>It didn’t seem like it was going to come back anytime soon either. Jenny Slate made a big statement when she said, “I’d love to be his friend one day, but we threw down pretty hard. No regrets, though.” That kind of finality is one that only a woman scorned by an ex-lover could confidently claim.</p><p>Their relationship ended fairly soon, by the standards of regular relationships, but keep in mind that they’d known each other for ages before officially dating.</p><h2 id=but-hopes-soared-when-they-rekindled-a-friendship-in-2017><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>But Hopes Soared When They Rekindled A Friendship In 2017</span></h2><p>A good relationship starts with a strong friendship. Right? Just think about your own life: how many of your good relationships started from being friends first, huh? In hindsight, we can say that this friendship definitely foreshadowed their reunion. At the time, though, we were just relieved to see that they were on good working terms again. There’s nothing worse than additional tension on a film set, you know?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=thanks-to-working-on-set-together><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Thanks To Working On Set Together</span></h2><p>One of the biggest things about the relationship that we noticed is that Chris Evans and Jenny Slate got really close while working with each other again. It makes sense that working together again would bring their relationship back in full force. We didn’t assume at the time that it would result in them getting back together, but we certainly did hope for that to happen. Set life can make for some intense connections.</p><h2 id=social-media-posts-followed><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Social Media Posts Followed</span></h2><p>And of course, like any pair of new-old-friends would, they posted on social media. A few key posts went out which hinted that Evans had Slate staying over at his place, which is tantamount to a red carpet reveal in our opinion. A few flirty exchanges and the whole world was excited at the prospect that they would get back together. After all, they were total goals!</p><p><span class=related-single>&nbsp;RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Celeb Social Media Posts That Didn't Quite Go As Planned</a>&nbsp;</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=and-then-started-dating-again-yes><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>And Then Started Dating Again! Yes!</span></h2><p>Oh man, talk about hopes soaring. All of a sudden, we started thinking about wedding gowns and romantic floral bouquets. Thanks to some choice social media posts (i.e. Internet flirting) we all came to realize that Jenny Slate and Chris Evans were indeed dating again. And yes, they were as cute as the first time around. Exes who get back together either last forever, or can’t quite make it work.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Worst Pieces Of Old-School Dating Advice (+ 10 Tips That Work)</a></span></p><h2 id=but-ended-again><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>&nbsp;But Ended. AGAIN.</span></h2><p>These two, unfortunately, ended up in the latter position. They just couldn’t make it work, no matter how hard they tried. Round two ended with a fiery crash. At least, that’s what we’re assuming. They haven’t really been seen together since, and we’re not sure that they even follow each other on social media. Plus, there’s been some big changes in their respective lives. Some big romantic changes, that is!</p><p><span class=related-single>&nbsp;RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Celeb Break Ups You Probably Missed This Year</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=and-jenny-seemed-to-find-her-true-love><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>And Jenny Seemed To Find Her True Love</span></h2><p>Yes, Jenny Slate ended up finding her true love in Ben Shattuck, and they’re officially engaged. They’ve been together for at least a year now, and we’re willing to bet that they knew each other before that, as well. Is this something that will last forever? Who knows! We hope it does, but we also recognize that relationships can be tricky to deal with. If we had to bet on it, we would wager that this pair is forever.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicki Minaj Changes Her Last Name On Social Media: Breakup Rumors Swirl</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihnqaernq0uMCtnGabmKe2tHnEr5inq12nsq2t06Kmp6uYnr1uwMimnKWhnpp8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
