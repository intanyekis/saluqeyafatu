From luxury goods to superior experiences, being among the stars comes with perks that most people can only imagine. And <strong><a href=#>Taylor Swift</a></strong>, who has won multiple awards in the music industry including an Emmy, has recently received an exceptional treatment that many may not contemplate.With all that fame and riches, people would expect a wonderful life. Designer clothing, fast vehicles, large homes, and gourmet meals appear to be rather standard benefits for someone who has gotten to the top of the entertainment business.What fans might not realize is that all of Taylor’s followers are out in the world making their own imprint in their areas, and some of them are entomologists. In fact, a scientist recently named a twisted-claw millipede after Taylor Swift.<span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here’s Why Taylor Swift Is The Perfect Role Model</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=taylor-swift-has-a-millipede-named-after-her>Taylor Swift Has A Millipede Named After Her</h2><p>Having a bug named after her probably isn’t high on Taylor Swift’s list of priorities. It is probably not that prestigious of an honor for the singer – especially considering her record and achievements in the industry. Although it is a privilege bestowed to the likes of the celebrity, having a creature out there is just a little bit weird.</p><p>Now, the popular singer-songwriter can add an unusual record to her growing list of accolades – a new millipede species named after her. The creature in question is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a twisted-claw millipede dubbed Nannaria swiftae</a>, which is one of 17 new species identified by Dr. Derek Hennen, an entomologist and myriapodologist. But why did the scientist come up with naming it after Taylor Swift?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Dr. Hennen made the announcement on his Twitter page in early 2022. He said that as a fan, he named the arthropod after the singer to show his appreciation for his idol. “This new millipede species is Nannaria swiftae: I named it after [Taylor Swift]! I’m a big fan of her music so I wanted to show my appreciation by naming this new species from Tennessee after her. A high honor!”</p><p>Despite their creepy appearance, millipedes are beneficial to our environment. They eat rotting plant matter and release minerals into the soil, enriching it. The innocuous animals are skilled diggers who spend most of their time underground. They produce chemical toxins when threatened, which dissuade but do not kill a potential predator.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here’s Why A Specific Syndrome Was Named After Jimmy Fallon</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=taylor-swift-rsquo-s-fans-mixed-reactions-to-the-news>Taylor Swift’s Fans Mixed Reactions To The News</h2><p>The singer has not yet made public her thoughts on the scientist’s tribute. This led her fans to describe her silence as “deafening.” They flocked to social media to express their surprise and unbelief at the news.</p><p>One Swiftie wrote, “Not to be serious or anything but Taylor Swift’s silence on the millipede that was named after her is truly deafening.” Another fan noted that given the singer’s “cute and nerdy” personality, she would definitely want to “say something about that.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A fan wrote, “The reach of her influence. I’m definitely going to discover something now just to name it after her.” Another commented, “At this point, Swifties are literally everywhere inside this planet and outside too!!!” while one joked, “and they say she has no impact…even the millipedes are streaming.”</p><p>Meanwhile, not everyone felt the same way and saw this act as an insult to their idol. One confused fan remarked, “I still don’t know if that’s an insult or an honour. I can’t make up my mind,” while another commented, “The intentions of this is so, so sweet, but I feel like many people could and will take as insulting to her…”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Taylor Swift, an 11-time Grammy Award winner, should undoubtedly feel honored to have her name passed on in such an impressive way. She is one of the celebrities that has received this benefit, but she isn't the only one!</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>These Are Taylor Swift’s Most Memorable Film And TV Appearances</a></span></p><p><a href=#>Scientists also named a bug after Queen Beyoncé</a>. The beyonceae fly is only found in north Queensland, Australia. The species of horsefly is very rare, which could also describe the superstar and her range of talents. The discovery and naming happened back in 2012, but the odds are pretty high that she had too much going on to comment about the bug in her honor.</p><p>Moreover, scientists have discovered a <a href=#>super-old fossil with some distinguishing characteristics.</a> The new fossil, called Kootenichela deppi, earned its name from its scissor-like claws. Remember how Johnny Depp played Edward Scissorhands? That is where the inspiration for the fossil came from.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Taylor Swift, Johnny Depp, and Queen Bey are not the only ones, either; many celebrities have been granted the privilege of influencing researchers and entomologists in their naming practices.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Here’s Why A Plant Was Named After Lady Gaga</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqnKGVo8Gqv9NmpZqllZl6rrXLpaCpnZSaeqKy056pZqyRrrmwvoysrqKepGQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
