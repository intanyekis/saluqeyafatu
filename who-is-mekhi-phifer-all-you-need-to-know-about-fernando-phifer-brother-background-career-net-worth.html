Following his practically overnight success in Spike Lee’s Clockers, he made appearances in the popular ensemble comedy Soul Food, the second-biggest slasher series of the time, I Still Know What You Did Last Summer, and the infamous Brandy and Monica “boy is mine” fight scene.</p><p>The New Yorker was successful long into the twenty-first century, scoring significant parts in blockbuster films like 8 Mile, Honey, and Dawn of the Dead. Additionally, he starred in MTV-friendly interpretations of Othello and Carmen and appeared for six seasons as the sad Dr. Gregory Pratt in ER (we’re still grieving his passing).</p><p>Phifer has never been short of employment, but in comparison to his prime, his resume over the past five years has been somewhat low-key. Here’s a look at why it could be difficult for you to recall the last time you saw the formerly ubiquitous star on your screen.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Mekhi_Phifer_loves_stay_off_the_Media></span>Mekhi Phifer loves stay off the Media<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mekhi Phifer has mostly succeeded in keeping his colorful private life out of the media despite having married and divorced his High School High co-star Malinda Williams, had a child with one-time fiancée Oni Southara, and was married a second time to NBC creative director Reshelet Barnes.</p><p>And the reason for that is that the Clockers lead intentionally chose not to engage in media manipulation. Regarding his lack of tabloid attention, Phifer told theGrio in a 2020 interview, “You aren’t going to find me out at the club, at the 40/40 or something like that.” The publication mentioned that Morris Chestnut and Omar Epps are two of the New Yorker’s friends in the entertainment industry. And he once had supper with none other than Sidney Poitier at the home of music producer Quincy Jones.</p><p>The Oscar winner told Phifer, “They won’t pay to watch your movies on Saturday if they see you at the club on Friday,” and Phifer claimed he has always been determined to follow that advice. It’s a rule that has kept the actor out of the public eye and controversy anytime he’s not working.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Business></span>Business <span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mekhi is the owner of a Athlete’s Foot store. Given that it’s simple to assume that people will always need shoes and that in that case many of them will want the best they can get, it would seem that shoe stores are a safe investment. This involves paying the highest prices for quality and for the types of shoes that are known to carry at least some level of prestige with them.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Net_Worth></span>Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mekhi Phifer is an American actor with a $500k net worth. His roles in films like “8 Mile,” “Clockers,” and “Paid in Full” are arguably what made him most well-known. Mekhi Phifer has hit some financial snags recently, which we go into more depth about in the section below. Most notably, he declared bankruptcy in 2014, having reportedly owed more than $1 million to the IRS alone at that time.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Mekhi_Phifer></span>Mekhi Phifer<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mekhi Phifer and Malinda Williams, an actress, had a baby together.
