Interspersed are clips of other attendees as well as the horses racing along the track.</p><p>In a statement, PETA slammed the music video for glamorizing horse racing, noting that over 7,500 horses are slaughtered every year for the practice. That means 3 race horses die every day in the U.S. from racing.</p><p>“Jack Harlow’s glamorized portrayal of horse racing is missing the whips, drugs, and deaths that run rampant in the industry,” PETA’s Senior Vice President Kathy Guillermo stated in a press release.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>PETA encouraged Jack to donate towards the care of American Thoroughbreds who are destined for slaughter after their racing careers have ended.</p><p>“Profiting from the abuse of others is never acceptable, and PETA is calling on Jack Harlow to pony up and pay for the care of American Thoroughbreds who would otherwise be shipped to foreign slaughterhouses,” the VP continued.</p><p>According to <a href=#>The Spruce Pets</a>, it costs an average of $5 per day to take care of a horse, at a minimum, or $1,800 per year.</p><p>So far, neither Jack nor Drake have responded to PETA’s criticism of the video.</p><p>Jack is certainly <a href=#>not the first celebrity to come under fire from PETA</a> over the years.

BRONCO," Ciara captioned a video of herself and her husband, which revealed he’d surprised her with the pup for Mother’s Day. "The kids call her Bronco Love Brownie:) The sweetest surprise. I love you baby @DangeRussWilson.”</p><p>However, PETA issued a statement criticizing the couple for apparently adopting the dog from a breeder.</p><p>"PETA is calling on the couple to Level Up on kindness by adopting a companion for this pup instead of fueling the homeless-animal crisis,” PETA stated, making reference to Ciara’s hit song. "One, Two Step mistake by killing a shelter dog's chances of finding a home."</p><p>The couple declined to comment on the backlash.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Nene Leakes Being Sued By Boyfriend’s Wife For Homewrecking</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Hypebeast</a>, <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a>, <a href=#>The Spruce Pets</a>,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS3oq%2FKZp%2BaqpykxG6%2Fy5qkpp2UYr2mwMBmn6iqo5p6s63CoqWgZZ2qwKqvjK%2BgnZ2fZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
