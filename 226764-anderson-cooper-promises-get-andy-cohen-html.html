The two men have had each other to lean on in some of their milestone moments, as they share quite a lot in common.</p><p class=Fg>This year has been just as monumental for them. Cooper welcomed his son, Wyatt, in April.

Despite the failed date, they chose to be friends instead and have been so since.</p><p class=Fg>Over the years, the pair has had to lean on each other — both personally and professionally. As <a class="Xd a" href=#>Cohen</a> recovered from the novel coronavirus earlier this year, Cooper was by his side, supporting him.</p><p class=Fg>As far as two peas in a pod go, it's almost impossible for Cohen and Cooper to be more identical.
