We aim to pour all of that love into this child in an effort to make him/her the next great, ginger, genius.”</p><p>He continued: “While we are entering into this new stage of life with immense gratitude, we know the season of waiting too and send love & strength to anyone else hoping to one day become parents themselves. Dare we say, future Challenge champion?”</p><p>The reality star and the yoga instructor <a href=#>tied the knot</a> in June 2018, after the <a href=#>two-time Challenge winner</a> popped the question two years earlier at a <a href=#>Kansas City Royals game</a>. Many of Bergmann’s MTV costars were in attendance for the couple’s summer nuptials including <a href=#><strong>Lacey Buehler</strong></a>, <strong>Rachel Moyal</strong>, <a href=#><strong>Nehemiah Clark</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Melinda Stolp</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Devin Walker</strong></a>. The <a href=#>Real World Austin</a> alums posed for a photo with the bride and groom.</p><p>“Congrats, @westonbergmann! 😍💍,” read the caption of the pic shared via the Challenge’s <a href=#>Instagram</a> page.</p><p>Following the ceremony, Bergmann opened up to <a href=#>MTV News</a> about the special day for him and his longtime love.</p><p>“My favorite part of the wedding was the vows,” he recalled in June 2018. “They were the most beautiful combination of seriousness and hilarity.”</p><p>After the twosome exchanged their vows, they began to build a life of their own. The duo expanded their family <a href=#>with their pooch, Penny</a>, who has often been featured on their respective social media pages.</p><p>“I’m blessed to have a family of strong, beautiful, women!” Bergmann <a href=#>captioned a selfie</a> of him, his wife and their furry friend.</p><p>Most recently, the Kansas native took home the cash prize and champion title for the Challenge: All-Stars season in July 2022. In an interview with <a href=#>E! News</a>, Bergmann revealed what <a href=#>he bought with his winnings</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I know everyone’s playing for all sorts of different reasons, but, like, hasn’t <a href=#>everyone always wanted a Lamborghini</a>?” he said at the time. “I feel like it’s actually more responsible to buy a Lamborghini than it would be to support my family.”</p><p>In addition to the luxury car, the reality TV veteran also shared that he purchased flights for several of his fellow Challengers to come to his hometown in Kansas City to <a href=#>film an unofficial reunion</a>, which fans could watch online. Bergmann admitted <a href=#>the kind gesture</a> ended up costing him “tens of thousands of dollars” in the end.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatoJVisKmty6Wcp5%2BVqHq4sdJmmZ6ql6Kur7rSZq6inpVivbOxxqeYp6xdmsWxscKtoKefXWbAtXnCoaClnF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
