Salary, Earnings</span></h2><p>Paul has come a long way since entering his father’s business at the age of 12 and polishing his fabricator talents to become one of the most notable bike makers. Well, with celebrity comes fortune, so let’s find out how wealthy Paul Teutul is. According to reliable sources, Paul’s <strong>net worth</strong> is more than $2 million as of 2022.</p><h2><span id=Paul_Teutul_Jr-_Birth_Age_Ethnicity_Siblings_Education>Paul Teutul Jr.- Birth, Age, Ethnicity, Siblings, Education</span></h2><p>Paul was born on October 2, 1974, in Orange County, New York, USA. He grew up in Orange County with his brothers Michael and Daniel, as well as his sister Cristin, as the oldest child of Paul Teutul and his first wife Paula. His father, Paul Sr., is a well-known motorcycle builder who founded Orange County Choppers in 1999 but had his own fabrication company before that called Orange County Ironworks. Unfortunately, no information is available concerning Paul’s education; nonetheless, inspired by his father’s profession, Paul joined the family business and has been involved in motorcycle design and manufacture ever since.</p><h2><span id=Paul_Teutul_Jr-_Relationship_Married_Life>Paul Teutul Jr.- Relationship, Married Life</span></h2><p>When he is not working, Paul Jr. is a husband and father; he has been married to Rachael Biester since August 2010, and the couple has a son, Hudson Seven Teutul, born on February 3, 2015. The duo has been on TLC’s “Say Yes to the Dress.”</p><h2><span id=Paul_Teutul_Jr-_Professional_Career>Paul Teutul Jr.- Professional Career</span></h2><p>Paul became one of those responsible for the company’s success when his father founded Orange County Choppers, and he has done an excellent job thanks to his knowledge and passion for motorcycles. The business gradually improved, attracting the notice of Discovery Channel show producers, and they became the focus of the reality TV series “American Chopper: The Series” in 2003.</p><h3><span id=8220American_Chopper_The_Series8221>“American Chopper: The Series”</span></h3><p>The show covers the Teutul family’s business activities at Orange County Choppers; as the show proceeded, Paul Sr. and Paul Jr. had arguments that became a trademark of the show. Their disagreements became increasingly heated over time, resulting in a schism between father and son. Regardless, the show ran on Discovery Channel until 2007, when it was relocated to TLC, where it remained until 2012. However, Paul Jr. appeared in 58 episodes before leaving the shop and the series in 2008, returning briefly in 2009 and 2010, although his difficult relationship with Paul Sr. continued.</p><h3><span id=Paul_Jr_Creates>Paul Jr. Creates</span></h3><p>After leaving OCC, Paul Jr. founded his own motorcycle manufacturing company, Paul Jr. Designs, and began producing his own bikes as well as modifying old ones, such as the P-51 Mustang, GEICO Armed Forces, and “Black Widow” Bikes, among other projects. Paul was able to draw several personnel from his father’s company as a result of his own success, including his brother Michael, Vinnie Di Martino, then Robert “Nub” Collard, and Joe Puliafico.</p><p>The end result was the new reality TV show “American Chopper: Senior vs. Junior,” which ran on the Discovery Channel from 2010 to 2012, increasing his net worth and popularity. Cody Connelly, the last employee from his father’s company, joined him in 2014. Paul’s net worth and notoriety skyrocketed after his business was selected to create two Azeroth bikes for Blizzard Entertainment’s World of Warcraft, which debuted in the game in 2014. Paul was hired two years later to design two bikes for the film “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows.”</p><h3><span id=Lawsuit>Lawsuit</span></h3><p>Back in 2005, Paul Sr., Paul Jr., and Michael Teutul were sued for fraudulent transfer by Tom Derbyshire, Paul Sr business .’s partner who funded the production of “American Chopper: The Series.” Tom was supposed to be a part of the show and collect profits, but Paul Sr. found a method to exclude him from the arrangement, prompting the lawsuit, which eventually pulled Paul Sr. out of the firm and forced him into bankruptcy, while Orange County LLC was obliged to pay Tom $500,000 in damages.</p><h2><span id=Social_Media>Social Media</span></h2><p>Since achieving worldwide recognition, Paul Jr. has successfully expanded his impact from television to social media platforms, particularly Twitter, where his official account has more than 175,000 followers with whom he shares details about his profession and personal life. This includes the appearance of his bike in the “World of Warcraft” film and the bike in “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows.” He also has a sizable fan base on Facebook, with nearly two million fans on his official page.
