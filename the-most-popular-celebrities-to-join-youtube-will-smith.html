After all, the platform allows them to expand their reach to fans at their own pace, better than any press run or magazine interview could. On the quest for YouTube stardom, they often post behind-the-scene videos of their recent projects or just simply talk to their fans and take them through their day-to-day lives. From the great Will Smith to the explosive celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay, here are some of the Hollywood celebs who joined YouTube.</p><h2 id=will-smith><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Will Smith</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>First up, we have legendary actor Will Smith on this list, who joined the platform in the winter of 2017 shortly after his expensive, star-studded urban fantasy Bright aired on <strong><a href=#>Netflix</a></strong>. He's the newest, "Freshest Prince" of YouTube in front of his 9.8 million subscribers where he takes his fans into his day-to-day life. In fact, he does more than just posting daily vlogs and 5-minute trailers for his upcoming projects. His YouTube content possesses a really high production value, making him stand out from the rest of the celebrities on the platform. His YouTube original, Best Shape of My Life, just aired last year.</p><h2 id=dwayne-39-the-rock-39-johnson><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite his tough-guy persona on the screen and in the wrestling ring, <strong><a href=#>Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson</a></strong> is a literal sweetheart in real life. He has a dedicated YouTube channel where he takes his 6 million subscribers to his everyday journey, from his outrageous commitment in the gym to his recent movie projects.</p><p>Dwayne is currently gearing up to portray the titular hero of <strong><a href=#>DC Comics'</a></strong>Black Adam.

Under the moniker JablinksiGames, Jack reaches out to his 4.87 million subscribers from the comfort of his own home since December 2018. Additionally, he also gives fans a sneak peek into his musical business side, a comedy rock duo called Tenacious D which he formed with Kyle Grass back in 1994.</p><p>"Well, I’ve got another Tenacious D record that I’d like to make. Maybe one more movie. I’m kind of enjoying the idea of early retirement," the actor hinted an idea of retirement back in 2019 after his first Jumanji film, "Not so early. I’m 50. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I’ve been saying for a long time that this is the last movie. We’ll see. </a>I can’t really say what my next thing is because it’s too early; it’s a jinxer. I’ve got a couple of tricks up my sleeve. But not too many. I’m looking to wrap it up pretty soon. Ride off into the sunset."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=gordon-ramsay><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Gordon Ramsay</span></h2><p>Gordon Ramsay has done more in television history than just being remembered as the explosive chef who yells "idiot sandwich" every 10 minutes. A versatile entertainer, he's juggled one line of work to the next, ranging from a powerful on-screen personality to a successful restaurateur. In front of his 18.8 million subscribers, the British native shares his easy-to-cook recipes, day-to-day lives, and his recent venture in Next Level Chef. ​​​​​​ Two years ago, Forbes ranked him among <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the most paid celebrities of the year, </a>amassing over $70 million from the previous 12 months.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Biggest YouTube Controversies From The 2010s</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ryan-reynolds><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Ryan Reynolds</span></h2><p>With the title of one of Hollywood's biggest stars, it shouldn't come as a surprise that an actor of Ryan Reynolds' caliber succeeds on YouTube.

The Deadpool actor's business venture ranges from his production company Maximum Effort, his beverage line Aviation Gin, and his Welsh football club Wrexham AFC. He gives insight into his business empire and often posts quality comedies on his YouTube channel for his 3.5 million subscribers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=shay-mitchell><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Shay Mitchell</span></h2><p>Shay Mitchell is a woman of many characters. She's best known for her seven years stint as Emily Fields in Pretty Little Liars, Peach in love-sick thriller You, Stella on Hulu's Dollface, and many other iconic roles.
